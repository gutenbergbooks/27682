<h3 class="chapter2">THE THEORY OF COPERNICUS DROOP</h3>

<p>The two sisters were together in their garden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>Rebecca Wise, turned forty and growing slightly
gray at the temples, was moving slowly from one of
her precious plants to the next, leaning over each to
pinch off a dead leaf or count the buds. It was the
historic month of May, 1898, and May is the paradise
of flower lovers.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was eighteen years younger than her sister,
and the beauty of the village. Indeed, many declared
their belief that the whole State of New Hampshire
did not contain her equal.</p>

<p>She was seated on the steps of the veranda that
skirted the little white cottage, and the absent gaze
of her frank blue eyes was directed through the gate
at the foot of the little path bordered by white rose-bushes.
In her lap was a bundle of papers yellowed
by age and an ivory miniature, evidently taken from
the carved wooden box at her side.</p>

<p>Presently Rebecca straightened her back with a
slight grimace and looked toward her sister, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
her mold-covered hands and fingers spread away from
her.</p>

<p>"Well," she inquired, "hev ye found anythin'?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be brought her gaze back from infinity and
replied:</p>

<p>"No, I ain't. Only that one letter where Isaac
Burton writes her that the players have come to
town."</p>

<p>"I don't see what good them letters'll do ye in the
Shakespeare class, then."</p>

<p>Rebecca spoke listlessly&mdash;more interested in her
garden than in her sister's search.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Ph&oelig;be rejoined, dreamily. "It's
awful funny&mdash;but whenever I take out these old
letters there comes over me the feelin' that I'm 'way
off in a strange country&mdash;and I feel like somebody
else."</p>

<p>Rebecca looked up anxiously from her work.</p>

<p>"Them sort o' philanderin' notions are foolish,
Ph&oelig;be," she said, and flicked a caterpillar over the
fence.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be gave herself a little shake and began to tie
up the papers.</p>

<p>"That's so," she replied. "But they will come
when I get these out, an' I got 'em out thinkin' the'
might be somethin' about Shakespeare in 'em for our
class."</p>

<p>She paused and looked wistfully at the letters
again.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, "how I do wonder if he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
among those players at the Peacock Inn that day!
You know 'players' is what they called play-actors
in those days, and he was a play-actor, they say."</p>

<p>"Did he live very far back, then?" said Rebecca,
wishing to appear interested, but really intent upon
a new sprout at the foot of the lilac-bush.</p>

<p>"Yes, three hundred years ago. Three of these
letters has a date in 1598 exactly."</p>

<p>There was a long silence, and at length Rebecca
looked up from the ground to ascertain its cause.
She frowned and drew her aching back stiffly straight
again.</p>

<p>"Everlastin'ly lookin' at that pictur'!" she exclaimed.
"I declare to goodness, Ph&oelig;be Wise, folks'll
think you're vain as a pouter pigeon."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be laughed merrily, tossed the letters into the
box and leaped to her feet. The miniature at which
she had been gazing was still in her hands.</p>

<p>"Folks'll never see me lookin' at it, Rebecca&mdash;only
you," she said.</p>

<p>Then with a coaxing tone and looking with appealing
archness at her sister, she went on:</p>

<p>"Is it really like me, Rebecca? Honest true?"</p>

<p>The elder woman merely grunted and moved on
to the next bed, and Ph&oelig;be, with another laugh, ran
lightly into the house.</p>

<p>A few moments later she reappeared at the front
door with consternation on her face.</p>

<p>"Land o' goodness, Rebecca!" she cried, "do you
know what time it is? Near onto one o'clock, an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
I've got to be at the Shakespeare class at half past.
We'll have to dish up dinner right this minute, and
I don't see how I can change my dress after it an'
help with the dishes too."</p>

<p>She whisked into the house again, and Rebecca followed
her as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>She was very proud of her baby sister, proud of
her having been "clear through high school," and
proud of her eminence in the local literary society.
There was certainly something inspiring in having
a sister who was first corresponding secretary of the
Women's Peltonville Association for the Study of
Shakespearian History and Literature; and it was
simply wonderful how much poetry she could repeat
from the pages of her favorite author.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Peltonville Center, New Hampshire, was one of
those groups of neatly kept houses surrounding a
prettily shaded, triangular common which seem to be
characteristic of New England. Standing two miles
from the nearest railway station, this little settlement
possessed its own combined store and post-office, from
whose narrow veranda one might watch the rising
generation playing Saturday base-ball on the grassy
triangle.</p>

<p>The traditional old meeting-house stood on the opposite
side of the common, facing the store. The
good old days of brimstone theology were past, and
the descendants of the godly Puritans who raised this
steeple "in the fear of the Lord," being now deprived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of their chief source of fear, found Sunday meetings
a bore, and a village pastor an unnecessary
luxury.</p>

<p>Indeed, there seemed little need of pastoral admonition
in such a town as Peltonville Center. There was
a grimly commonplace and universal goodness everywhere,
and the village was only saved from unconsciousness
of its own perfection by the individual
shortcomings of one of its citizens. Fortunately for
the general self-complacence, however, the necessary
revealing contrast was found in him.</p>

<p>Copernicus Droop was overfond of the bottle, and
in spite of the prohibition laws of his State, he proved
himself a blessed example and warning by a too frequent
and unmistakable intoxication in public. He
was gentle and even apologetic in his cups, but he was
clearly a "slave of rum" and his mission was therefore
fulfilled.</p>

<p>On this first of May, 1898, a number of idle young
men sat in a row on the edge of the store veranda.
Some were whittling, some making aimless marks in
the dust with a stick. All leaned limply forward,
with their elbows on their knees.</p>

<p>It was clearly not a Sunday, for the meeting-house
was open, and from time to time, one or perhaps two
young women together passed into the cool and silent
room. The loungers at the store let none escape their
notice, and the name of each damsel was passed down
the line in an undertone as its owner entered the
church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>A lantern-jawed young farmer at the end of the
row slowly brushed the shavings from his clothes and
remarked:</p>

<p>"Thet's the secon' meetin' of the Shekspeare class
this month, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Yep, an' there'll be two more afore the summer
boarders comes up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The second speaker would have continued, but he
was here interrupted by a third, who whispered
loudly:</p>

<p>"Say, fellers, there goes Copernicus."</p>

<p>All eyes were raised and unanimously followed the
shabby figure which had just emerged from behind
the church and now started into the road leading
away from the common toward the north.</p>

<p>"Walks pretty straight fer him, don't he?" snickered
the first speaker.</p>

<p>"He's not ben tight fer two days."</p>

<p>"Bet ye a jack-knife he'll be spreein' it fer all he's
wuth to-morrow."</p>

<p>Fortunately these comments did not reach the ears
of their object, who, all unconscious of the interest
which he inspired, made good his way at a fairly
rapid pace.</p>

<p>Presently he stopped.</p>

<p>With muslin skirts swaying, hair rumpled, and fair
young face flushed with exertion, Ph&oelig;be Wise was
hurrying toward the common. She was almost running
in her haste, for she was late and the Shakespeare
class was a momentous institution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, say, Cousin Ph&oelig;be," was the man's greeting,
"can you tell me ef yer sister's to home?"</p>

<p>The young girl came to a sudden full stop in her
surprise. This cousinly greeting from the village
reprobate was as exciting and as inexplicable as it was
unheard of.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Droop!" she exclaimed, "I&mdash;I&mdash;I
s'pose so."</p>

<p>The truth was the truth, after all. But it was
hard on Rebecca. What <i>could</i> this man want with
her sister?</p>

<p>Droop nodded and passed on.</p>

<p>"Thank ye. Don't stop fer me," he said.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be moved forward slowly, watching Copernicus
over her shoulder. She noted his steady steps and
pale face and, reassured, resumed her flying progress
with redoubled vigor. After all, Rebecca was forty-two
years old and well able to take care of herself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rebecca Wise, having carefully wrung
out her dishcloth, poured out the water and swept the
little sink, was slowly untying her kitchen apron, full
of a thankful sense of the quiet hour before her
wherein to knit and muse beside the front window of
her little parlor.</p>

<p>In the centre of this room there stood a wide, round
table, bearing a large kerosene-lamp and the week's
mending. At the back and opposite the two windows
stood the well-blacked, shiny, air-tight stove.
Above this was a wooden mantel, painted to imitate
marble, whereon were deposited two photographs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
four curious Chinese shells, and a plaster cross to
which there clung a very plaster young woman in
scant attire, the whole being marked "Rock of Ages"
in gilt letters at the base.</p>

<p>Horse-hair furniture in all the glory of endless
"tidies" was arranged against walls bedight with
a rainbow-like wilderness of morning-glories. The
ceiling was of white plaster, and the floor was painted
white and decked here and there with knitted rag-carpets,
on whose Joseph's-coated surfaces Rebecca
loved to gaze when in retrospective mood. In those
humble floor-coverings her knowing eyes recognized
her first clocked stockings and Ph&oelig;be's baby cloak.
There was her brother Robert's wool tippet embalmed
in loving loops with the remnants of his wife's
best Sunday-go-to-meetin' ribbons. These two had
long been dead, but their sister's loving eyes recreated
them in rag-carpet dreams wherein she lived
again those by-gone days.</p>

<p>Rebecca had just seated herself and was unrolling
her work, when her eyes caught a glimpse of a man's
form through the window. He had passed into her
gate and was approaching the door. She leaned forward
for a good look and then dropped back into her
chair with a gasp of surprise.</p>

<p>"Copernicus Droop!" she exclaimed, "did you ever!"</p>

<p>She sat in rigid astonishment until she heard his
timid knock, followed by the sound of shoes vigorously
wiped upon the door-mat.</p>

<p>"Well, come! Thet's a comfort!" she thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
"He won't muss the carpet"&mdash;and she rose to admit
her visitor.</p>

<p>"Good mornin'," said Droop, timidly. "I seen
Cousin Ph&oelig;be a-runnin' down the road, an' I sorter
thought I'd run in an' see how you was."</p>

<p>"Come right in," said Rebecca, in non-committal
tones. She shut the door and followed him into the
parlor.</p>

<p>"Here, give me yer hat," she continued. "Set
right there. How be ye?"</p>

<p>Droop obeyed. In a few moments the two were
seated facing each other, and Rebecca's needles were
already busy. There was an interval of awkward
silence.</p>

<p>"Well, what did ye come fer?"</p>

<p>It was Rebecca who broke the spell. In her usual
downright fashion, she came to the point at once.
She thought it as well he should know that she was
not deceived by his polite pretence of casual friendly
interest.</p>

<p>Droop settled forward with elbows on his knees and
brought his finger-tips carefully and accurately together.
He found this action amazingly promotive
of verbal accuracy.</p>

<p>"Well, Cousin Rebecca," he began, slowly, "I'm
lookin' fer a partner." He paused, considering how
to proceed.</p>

<p>The spinster let her hands drop in speechless wonder.
The audacity of the man! He&mdash;to her&mdash;a proposal!
At her age! From him!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately the next few words disclosed her
error, and she blushed for it as she lifted her work
again, turning nearer the window as if for better
light.</p>

<p>"Yes," Droop proceeded, "I've a little business
plan, an' it needs capital an' a partner."</p>

<p>He waited, but there was no response.</p>

<p>"Capital an' a partner," he repeated, "an' intelligence
an' ambition. So I come to you."</p>

<p>Rebecca turned toward him again, scarcely less
surprised now than before.</p>

<p>"To me! D'ye mean to say ye've me in yer mind
fer a partner&mdash;with capital?"</p>

<p>Droop nodded slowly and compressed his lips.</p>

<p>"Well, I want to know!" she exclaimed, helplessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you ain't overly rich right now,"
said Droop, apologetically; "but it warn't no secret
thet ye might hev hed Joe Chandler ef ye hadn't ben
so shifty in yer mind an' fell betwixt two stools&mdash;an'
Lord knows Joe Chandler was as rich as&mdash;as Peter
Craigin down to Keene&mdash;pretty nigh."</p>

<p>Again Rebecca blushed, but this time in anger.</p>

<p>"See here, Copernicus Droop&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean nothin' mean, now," he insisted,
earnestly. "I'm jest leadin' up to the pint sorter
natural like&mdash;breakin' the thing easy, ye know."</p>

<p>"What <i>air</i> you a-drivin' at?"</p>

<p>Droop shifted uneasily in his seat and ran his finger
around inside of his collar before he replied:</p>

<p>"Ye see, it's sorter hard to explain. It's this way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
I hev a mighty fine plan in my mind founded on a
mixin' up of astronomical considerations with prior
inventions&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mister Droop!" exclaimed his hostess, gazing severely
into his eyes, "ef you think I'll let you go to
drinkin' rum till&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Honest to goodness, Miss Wise, I've not teched a
drop!" cried Droop, leaping to his feet and leaning
forward quickly. "You may smell my breath ef&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A violent push sent him back to his chair.</p>

<p>"Thet'll do, Mr. Droop. I'll undertake to believe
ye fer once, but I'll thank ye to speak plain English."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," he sighed, plaintively. "I don't
blame ye fer not takin' to it quick. I didn't myself
at first. Well&mdash;here. Ye see&mdash;ye know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused and swallowed hard, gazing at the ceiling
for inspiration. Then he burst out suddenly:</p>

<p>"Ye know the graphophone an' the kodak and the
biograph an' all them things what ye can see down
to Keene?"</p>

<p>Rebecca nodded slowly, with suspicion still in her
eye.</p>

<p>"Well, the's a heap o' things ben invented since
the Centennial of 1876. Don't you s'pose they've
made hills o' money out o' them things&mdash;with patents
an' all?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"An' don't you s'pose that ef anybody in 1876 was
to up an' bring out sech inventions all at once he'd
be bigger than all the other inventors put together!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Rebecca slowly pushed her needle through her
hair, which was a sign of thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>"Wal, o' course," she said, at length, "ef anybody
hed aben smart enough to've invented all them things
in 1876 he'd aben a pretty big man, I guess."</p>

<p>Droop edged forward eagerly.</p>

<p>"An' s'posen' that you hed married Joe Chandler
back in 1876, an' you was rich enough to back up
an inventor like that, an' he come to you an' offered
to give you half ef you'd up an' help him put 'em on
the market, an' s'posen'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What the land sake's the use o' s'posin'?" Rebecca
cried, sharply. "This is 1898, an' I ain't married,
thanks be to goodness!"</p>

<p>"Ah, but ye could be, ef we was in 1876! There,
there&mdash;I know what you want to say&mdash;but 'taint so!
What would ye say ef I was to tell ye that all ye've
got to do is jest to get into a machine I've got an' I
can take ye back to 1876 in next to no time! What
would ye say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd say ye was tighter'n a boiled owl, Copernicus
Droop."</p>

<p>"But I ain't, I ain't!" he almost screamed. "I tell
ye I hevn't teched liquor fer two days. I've reformed.
Ef ye won't smell my breath&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you're plum crazy," she interrupted.</p>

<p>"No, nor crazy either," he insisted. "Why, the
whole principle of it is so awful simple! Ef you'd
ben to high school, now, an' knew astronomy an' all,
you'd see right through it like nothin'."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then, you c'n explain it to them as hez ben
to high school, an' that's sister Ph&oelig;be. Here she
comes now."</p>

<p>She went at once to the door to admit the new-comer.
Her visitor, watching the pretty younger
sister as she stepped in, rosy and full of life, could not
but remark the contrast between the two women.</p>

<p>"Twenty-two years makes a heap o' difference!"
he muttered. "But Rebecca was jest as pretty herself,
back in 1876."</p>

<p>"Look, Rebecca!" cried Ph&oelig;be, as she entered the
door, "here's a new book Mrs. Bolton lent me to-day.
All about Bacon writing Shakespeare's plays, an' how
Bacon was a son of Queen Elizabeth. Do you s'pose
he really did?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't ask me, child!" was the nervous reply.
"Mr. Droop's in the parlor."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be had forgotten her short interview with
Droop, and she now snatched off her hat in surprise
and followed her elder sister, nodding to their visitor
as she entered.</p>

<p>"Set down, both o' ye," said Rebecca. "Now,
then, Mr. Droop, perhaps you'll explain."</p>

<p>Rebecca was far more mystified and interested
than she cared to admit. Her brusque manner was
therefore much exaggerated&mdash;a dissimulation which
troubled her conscience, which was decidedly of the
tenderest New England brand.</p>

<p>Poor Copernicus experienced a sense of relief as
he turned his eyes to those of the younger sister. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
felt that Rebecca's manner was distinctly cold, and
her own expression was the more cordial in compensation.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Ph&oelig;be," he said, eagerly, "I've ben
tellin' your sister about my plan to go back to the
Centennial year&mdash;1876, ye know."</p>

<p>"To&mdash;to what, Mr. Droop?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be's polite cordiality gave place to amazed consternation.
Droop raised a deprecating hand.</p>

<p>"Now don't you go to think I'm tight or gone
crazy. You'll understand it, fer you've ben to high
school. Now see! What is it makes the days go
by&mdash;ain't it the daily revolution of the sun?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be put on what her sister always called "that
schoolmarm look" and replied:</p>

<p>"Why, it's the turning round of the earth on its
axis once in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;It's all one&mdash;all one," Droop broke
in, eagerly. "To put it another way, it comes from
the sun cuttin' meridians, don't it?"</p>

<p>Rebecca, who found this technical and figurative
expression beyond her, paused in her knitting and
looked anxiously at Ph&oelig;be, to see how she would take
it. After a moment of thought, the young woman
admitted her visitor's premises.</p>

<p>"Very good! An' you know's well's I do, Miss
Ph&oelig;be, that ef a man travels round the world the
same way's the sun, he ketches up on time a whole
day when he gets all the way round. In other words,
the folks that stays at home lives jest one day more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
than the feller that goes round the world that way.
Am I right?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>Droop glanced triumphantly at Rebecca. This tremendous
admission on her learned young sister's part
stripped her of all pretended coldness. Her deep
interest was evident now in her whole pose and expression.</p>

<p>"Now, then, jest follow me close," Droop continued,
sitting far forward in his chair and pointing his
speech with a thin forefinger on his open palm.</p>

<p>"Ef a feller was to whirl clear round the world an'
cut all the meridians in the same direction as the sun,
an' he made the whole trip around jest as quick as
the sun did&mdash;time wouldn't change a mite fer him,
would it?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be gasped at the suggestion.</p>

<p>"Why, I should think&mdash;of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped and put her hand to her head in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Et's a sure thing!" Droop exclaimed, earnestly.
"You've said yerself that the folks who stayed to
home would live one day longer than the fellow that
went round. Now, ef that feller travelled round as
fast as the sun, the stay-at-homes would only be one
day older by the time he got back&mdash;ain't that a fact?"</p>

<p>Both sisters nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, an' the traveller would be one day younger
than they'd be. An' ain't that jest no older at all
than when he started?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"My goodness! Mr. Droop!" Ph&oelig;be replied,
feebly. "I never thought of that."</p>

<p>"Well, ain't it so?"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;leastways&mdash;why, it must be!"</p>

<p>"All right, then!"</p>

<p>Droop rose triumphantly to his feet, overcome by
his feelings.</p>

<p>"Follow out that same reasonin' to the bitter end!"
he cried, "an' what will happen ef that traveller
whirls round, cuttin' meridians jest twice as fast as
the sun&mdash;goin' the same way?"</p>

<p>He paused, but there was no reply.</p>

<p>"Why, as sure as shootin', I tell ye, that feller will
get jest one day younger fer every two whirls round!"</p>

<p>There was a long and momentous silence. The
tremendous suggestion had for the moment bereft
both women of all reasoning faculty.</p>

<p>At length the younger sister ventured upon a practical
objection.</p>

<p>"But how's he goin' to whirl round as fast as that,
Mr. Droop?" she said.</p>

<p>Droop smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>"Et does sound outlandish, when ye think how big
the world is. But what if ye go to the North Pole?
Ain't all the twenty-four meridians jammed up close
together round that part of the globe?"</p>

<p>"Thet's so," murmured Rebecca, "I've seen it
many's the time on the map in Ph&oelig;be's geography
book."</p>

<p>"Sure enough," Droop rejoined. "Then ain't it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
clear that ef a feller'll jest take a grip on the North
Pole an' go whirlin' round it, he'll be cuttin' meridians
as fast as a hay-chopper? Won't he see the
sun gettin' left behind an' whirlin' the other way
from what it does in nature? An' ef the sun goes the
other way round, ain't it sure to unwind all the time
thet it's ben a-rollin' up?"</p>

<p>Rebecca's ball of yarn fell from her lap at this,
and, as she followed it with her eyes, she seemed to
see a practical demonstration of Droop's marvellous
theory.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be felt all the tremendous force of Droop's
logic, and she flushed with excitement. One last
practical objection was obvious, however.</p>

<p>"The thing must be all right, Mr. Droop," she
said; "an' come to think of it, this must be the reason
so many folks have tried to reach the North Pole.
But it never <i>has</i> been reached yet, an' how are you
agoin' to do it?"</p>

<p>"You think it never hez," Copernicus replied.
"The fact is, though, that I've ben there."</p>

<p>"You!" Ph&oelig;be cried.</p>

<p>"And is there a pole there?" Rebecca asked,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"The's a pole there, an' I've swung round it, too,"
Droop replied, sitting again with a new and delightful
sense of no longer being unwelcome.</p>

<p>"Here's how 'twas. About a year ago there come
to my back door a strange-lookin' man who'd hurt his
foot some way. I took him in an' fixed him up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>&mdash;you
know I studied for a doctor once&mdash;an' while he
was bein' fixed up, he sorter took a fancy to me an'
he begun to give me the story of his life. He said he
was born in the year 2582, an' had ben takin' what
he called a historical trip into the past ages. He went
on at a great rate like that, an' I thought he was jest
wanderin' in his mind with the fever, so I humored
him. But he saw through me, an' he wouldn't take
no but I should go down into Burnham's swamp with
him to see how he'd done it.</p>

<p>"Well, down we went, and right spang in the
thickest of the bushes an' muck we come across the
queerest lookin' machine that ever ye see!</p>

<p>"Right there an' then he told me all the scientific
talk about time an' astronomy thet I've told you, an'
then he tuck me into the thing. Fust thing I knew
he give a yank to a lever in the machinery an' there
was a big jerk thet near threw me on the back o' my
head. I looked out, an' there we was a-flyin' over the
country through the air fer the North Pole!"</p>

<p>"There, now!" cried Rebecca, "didn't Si Wilkins'
boy Sam say he seen a comet in broad daylight last
June?"</p>

<p>"Thet was us," Droop admitted.</p>

<p>"And not a soul believed him," Ph&oelig;be remarked.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Droop, "to make a long story
short, thet future-man whirled me a few times 'round
the North Pole&mdash;unwound jest five weeks o' time,
an' back we come to Peltonville a-hummin'!"</p>

<p>"And then?" cried the two women together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ef you'll believe me, there we was back to the
day he fust come&mdash;an' fust thing I knew, thet future-man
was a-comin' up to my back door, same ez before,
a-beggin' to hev his foot fixed. It was hard on him,
but I was convinced fer keeps."</p>

<p>Copernicus shook his head sadly, with retrospective
sadness.</p>

<p>"An' where is the future-man now?" Ph&oelig;be asked.</p>

<p>"Tuk cold on his lungs at the North Pole," said
Droop, solemnly. "Hed pneumonia an' up'n died."</p>

<p>"But there warn't nobody round heerd of him
except you," said Rebecca. "Who buried him?"</p>

<p>"Ah, thet's one o' the beauties o' the hull business.
He'd showed me all the ropes on his machine&mdash;his
Panchronicon, as he called it&mdash;an' so I up'n
flew round the North Pole the opposite way as soon's
he passed away, till I'd made up the five weeks we'd
lost. Then when I got back it was five weeks after
his funeral, an' I didn't hev to bother about it."</p>

<p>The two sisters looked at each other, quite overcome
with admiration.</p>

<p>"My land!" Rebecca murmured, gathering up her
yarn and knitting again. "Sence they've invented
them X-rays an' took to picturin' folks' insides, I kin
believe anythin'."</p>

<p>"You don't hev to take my word fer it," Droop
exclaimed. "Ef you'll come right along with me this
blessed minute, I'll show you the machine right
now."</p>

<p>"I'd jest love to see it," said Rebecca, her coldness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
all forgotten, "but it's mos' too late fer this afternoon.
There's the supper to get, you know, an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the plan, Rebecca," Ph&oelig;be cried. "You've
forgotten that I haven't heard Mr. Droop's plan."</p>

<p>"I wish 't you'd call me 'Cousin Copernicus,'" said
Droop, earnestly. "You know I've sworn off&mdash;quit
drinkin' now."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be blushed at his novel proposal and insisted
on the previous question.</p>

<p>"But what is the plan?" she said.</p>

<p>"Why, my idea is this, Cousin Ph&oelig;be. I want we
should all go back to 1876 again. Thet's the year
your sister could hev married Joe Chandler ef she'd
wanted to."</p>

<p>Rebecca murmured something unintelligible, blushing
furiously, with her eyes riveted to her knitting.
Ph&oelig;be looked surprised.</p>

<p>"You know you could, Cousin Rebecca," Droop
insisted. "Now what I say is, let's go back there.
I'll invent the graphophone, the kodak, the vitascope,
an' Milliken's cough syrup an' a lot of other big modern
inventions. Rebecca'll marry Chandler, an' she
an' her husband can back up my big inventions with
capital. Why, Cousin Ph&oelig;be," he cried, with enthusiasm,
"we'll all hev a million apiece!"</p>

<p>The sentimental side of Droop's plan first monopolized
Ph&oelig;be's attention.</p>

<p>"Rebecca Wise!" she exclaimed, turning with
mock severity to face her sister. "Why is it I've
never heard tell about this love affair before now?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Why, Joe Chandler's just a <i>fine</i> man. Is it you that
broke his heart an' made him an old bachelor all his
life?"</p>

<p>Rebecca must have dropped a stitch, for she turned
toward the window again and brought her knitting
very close to her face.</p>

<p>"What brought ye so early to home, Ph&oelig;be?" she
said. "Warn't there no Shakespeare meetin' to-day?"</p>

<p>"No. Mis' Beecher was to lead, an' she's been
taken sick, so I came right home. But you can't
sneak out of answerin' me like that, Miss Slyboots,"
Ph&oelig;be continued, in high spirits.</p>

<p>Seating herself on the arm of her sister's chair,
she put her arms about her neck and, bending over,
whispered:</p>

<p>"Tell me honest, now, Rebecca, did Joe Chandler
ever propose to you?"</p>

<p>"No, he never did!" the elder sister exclaimed,
rising suddenly.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Droop," she continued, "your hull plan
is jest too absurd to think of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Droop tried to expostulate, but she raised her voice,
speaking more quickly.</p>

<p>"An' you come 'round again after supper an' we'll
tell ye what we've decided," she concluded.</p>

<p>The humor of this reply was lost on Copernicus,
but he moved toward the door with a sense of distinct
encouragement.</p>

<p>"Remember the rumpus we'll make with all them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
inventions," Droop called back as he walked toward
the gate, "think of the money we'll make!"</p>

<p>But Rebecca was thinking of something very different
as she stood at the front door gazing with
softened eyes at the pasture and woods beyond the
road. She seemed to see a self-willed girl breaking
her own heart and another's rather than acknowledge
a silly error. She was wondering if that had really
been Rebecca Wise. She felt again all the old bewitching
heart-pangs, sweetened and mellowed by
time, and she wondered if she were <i>now</i> really Rebecca
Wise.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">A VISIT TO THE PANCHRONICON</h3>


<p>At precisely eight o'clock that evening, a knock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
was again heard at the door of the Wise home, and
Droop was admitted by the younger sister. She did
not speak, and her face was invisible in the dark hall.
The visitor turned to the right and entered the parlor,
followed by his young hostess. Rebecca was sitting
by the lamp, sewing. As she looked up and
nodded, Droop saw that her features expressed only
gloomy severity. He turned in consternation and
caught sight for the first time of Ph&oelig;be's face. Her
eyes and pretty nose were red and her mouth was
drawn into a curve of plaintive rebellion.</p>

<p>"Set down, Mr. Droop. Give me yer hat," she
said; and there was a suspicious catch in her voice.</p>

<p>The visitor seated himself by the centre-table beside
the lamp and sat slowly rubbing his hands, the
while he gazed mournfully from one to the other of
the silent sisters. Ph&oelig;be sat on the long horse-hair
"settle," and played moodily with the tassel hanging
at its head.</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Each of the women
seemed bent on forcing the other to break the silence.</p>

<p>Poor Droop felt that his plans were doomed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
he dared not urge either woman to speech, lest he
hear the death-sentence of his hopes. Finally, however,
the awkward silence became unbearable.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said, inquiringly, still rubbing his
hands.</p>

<p>"Well," Rebecca exclaimed, "it seems it's not to
be done," and she looked reproachfully at Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>The words fulfilled his fears, but the tone and
glance produced a thrill of hope. It was evident that
Rebecca at least favored his plans.</p>

<p>Turning now to the younger sister, Droop asked,
in a melancholy tone:</p>

<p>"Don't you want to get rich, Cousin Ph&oelig;be?"</p>

<p>"Rich&mdash;me!" she replied, indignantly. "A mighty
lot of riches it'll bring me, won't it? That's just what
riles me so! You an' Rebecca just think of nothin'
but your own selves. You never stop to think of
me!"</p>

<p>Droop opened his eyes very wide indeed, and Rebecca
said, earnestly:</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be, you know you ain't got any call to say
sech a thing!"</p>

<p>"Oh, haven't I?" cried Ph&oelig;be, in broken accents.
"Did either of you think what would happen to me
if we all went back to 1876? Two years old! That's
what I'd be! A little toddling baby, like Susan Mellick's
Annie! Put to bed before supper&mdash;carried
about in everybody's arms&mdash;fed on a bottle and&mdash;and
perhaps&mdash;and perhaps getting <i>spanked</i>!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>With the last word, Ph&oelig;be burst into tears of
mingled grief and mortification and rushed from the
room.</p>

<p>The others dared not meet each other's guilty eyes.
Droop gazed about the room in painful indecision.
He could not bear to give up all hope, and yet&mdash;this
unforeseen objection really seemed a very serious
one. To leave the younger sister behind was out of
the question. On the other hand, the consequences
of the opposite course were&mdash;well, painful to her at
least.</p>

<p>In his nervousness he unconsciously grasped a
small object on the table upon which his left hand
had been lying. It was a miniature daintily painted
on ivory. He looked vacantly upon it; his mind at
first quite absent from his eyes. But as he gazed,
something familiar in the lovely face depicted there
fixed his attention. Before long he was examining
the picture with the greatest interest.</p>

<p>"Well, now!" he exclaimed, at length. "Ain't
that pretty! Looks jest like her, too. When was
that tuck, Miss Wise?"</p>

<p>"That ain't Ph&oelig;be," said Rebecca, dejectedly.</p>

<p>"Ain't Ph&oelig;be!" Droop cried, in amazement.
"Why, it's the finest likeness&mdash;why&mdash;but&mdash;it <i>must</i>
be yer sister!"</p>

<p>"Well, 'tain't. Thet pictur is jest three hundred
years old."</p>

<p>"Three hundred&mdash;" he began&mdash;then very slowly,
"Well, now, do tell!" he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be's got the old letter that tells about it.
The's a lot of 'em in that little carved-wood box
there. They say it come over in the Mayflower."</p>

<p>Droop could not take his eyes from the picture.
The likeness was perfect. Here was the pretty youthful
oval of her face&mdash;the same playful blue eye&mdash;the
sensitive red lips seeming about to sparkle into
a smile&mdash;even the golden brown mist of hair that
hid the delicately turned ear!</p>

<p>Then Droop suddenly remembered his plans, and
with his hand he dropped the picture as his mind dismissed
it. He rose and looked about for his hat.</p>

<p>"Ye wouldn't want to come back to '76 with me
an' leave Cousin Ph&oelig;be behind, would ye?" he suggested,
dismally.</p>

<p>"What!" cried Rebecca, giving vent to her pent-up
feelings, "an' never see my sister again! Why, I'd
hev to come livin' along up behind her, and, all I
could do, I'd never catch up with her&mdash;never! You'd
ought to be ashamed to stand there an' think o' sech a
thing, Copernicus Droop!"</p>

<p>For some time he stood with bent head and shoulders,
twirling his hat between his fingers. At length
he straightened up suddenly and moved toward the
door.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "the' isn't any use you seem' the
Panchronicon now, is the'?"</p>

<p>"What's it like, Mr. Droop?" Rebecca inquired.</p>

<p>He paused helpless before the very thought of description.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh," he said, weakly, "et's like&mdash;et's a&mdash;why&mdash;Oh,
it's a machine!"</p>

<p>"Hez it got wings?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly wings," he began, then, more earnestly,
"why don't ye come and see it, anyway!
It can't do ye any harm to jest look at it!"</p>

<p>Rebecca dropped her hands into her lap and replied,
with a hesitating manner:</p>

<p>"I'd like to fust rate&mdash;it must be an awful queer
machine! But I don't get much time fer traipsin'
'round now days."</p>

<p>"Why can't ye come right along now?" Droop
asked, eagerly. "It's dry as a bone underfoot down
in the swamp now. The's ben no rain in a long
time."</p>

<p>She pondered some time before replying. Her
first impulse was to reject the proposal as preposterous.
The hour seemed very ill chosen. Rebecca was
not accustomed to leaving home for any purpose at
night, and she was extremely conservative.</p>

<p>On the other hand, she felt that only under cover
of the darkness could she consent to go anywhere in
company with the village reprobate. Every tongue
in the place would be set wagging were she seen
walking with Copernicus Droop. She had not herself
known how strong was the curiosity which his startling
theories and incredible story had awakened in
her. She looked up at her visitor with indecision in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't see how I could go now," she said. "Be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>sides,
it's mos' too dark to see the thing, ain't
it?"</p>

<p>"Not a mite," he replied, confidently. "The's
lights inside I can turn on, an' we'll see the hull thing
better'n by daylight."</p>

<p>Then, as she still remained undecided, he continued,
in an undertone:</p>

<p>"Cousin Ph&oelig;be's up in her room, ain't she? Ye
might not get another chance so easy."</p>

<p>He had guessed instinctively that, under the circumstances,
Rebecca preferred not revealing to
Ph&oelig;be her own continued interest in the wonderful
machine.</p>

<p>The suggestion was vital. Ph&oelig;be was in all probability
sulking in her own bedroom, and in that event
would not quit it for an hour. It seemed now or
never.</p>

<p>Rebecca rolled up her knitting work and rose to
her feet.</p>

<p>"Jest wait here a spell," she said, rapidly. "I
won't be a minute!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Shortly afterward, two swiftly moving, shadowy
figures emerged from the little white gate and turned
into a dark lane made more gloomy by overhanging
maples. This was the shortest route to Burnham's
swamp.</p>

<p>Copernicus was now more hopeful. He could not
but feel that, if the elder sister came face to face with
his marvellous machine, good must result for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
plans. Rebecca walked with nervous haste, dreading
Ph&oelig;be's possible discovery of this most unconventional
conduct.</p>

<p>The night was moonless, and the two stumbled and
groped their way down the lane at a pace whose slowness
exasperated Rebecca.</p>

<p>"Ef I'd a-known!" she exclaimed, under her
breath.</p>

<p>"We're 'most there, Cousin Rebecca," said Copernicus,
with deprecating softness. "Here, give me
holt o' yer hand while we climb over the wall. Here's
Burnham's swamp right now."</p>

<p>Accepting the proffered aid, Rebecca found herself
in the midst of a thicket of bushes, many of
which were thorny and all of which seemed bent
upon repelling nocturnal adventurers.</p>

<p>Droop, going ahead, did his best to draw aside the
obstinate twigs, and Rebecca followed him with half-averted
head, lifting her skirts and walking sidewise.</p>

<p>"'Mighty lucky, 'tain't wet weather!" she mumbled.</p>

<p>At that moment her guide stood still.</p>

<p>"There!" he exclaimed, in a low, half-awed voice.</p>

<p>Rebecca stopped and gazed about. A little to the
right the dark gray of the sky was cut by a looming
black mass of uncertain form.</p>

<p>It looked like the crouching phantom of some
shapeless sea-monster. Rebecca half expected to see
it dissolve like a wind-driven fog.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Their physical sight could distinguish nothing of
the outer characteristics of this mysterious structure;
but for this very reason, the imagination was the
more active. Rebecca, with all her directness of
nature and commonplace experience, felt in this unwonted
presence that sense of awed mystery which
she would have called a "creepy feeling."</p>

<p>What unknown and incomprehensible forces were
locked within that formless mass? By what manner
of race as yet unborn had its elements been brought
together&mdash;no, no&mdash;<i>would</i> they be brought together?
How assume a comfortable mental attitude toward
this creation whose present existence so long antedated
its own origin?</p>

<p>One sentiment, at least, Rebecca could entertain
with hearty consistency. Curiosity asserted its supremacy
over every other feeling.</p>

<p>"Can't we get into the thing, an' light a candle or
suthin'?" she said.</p>

<p>"Of course we can," said Droop. "That's what I
brought ye here fer. Take holt o' my hand an' lift
yer feet, or you'll stumble."</p>

<p>Leading his companion by the hand, Copernicus
approached the dark form, moving with great caution
over the clumps of grassy turf. Presently he
reached the side of the machine. Rebecca heard him
strike it with his hand two or three times, as though
groping for something. Then she was drawn forward
again, and suddenly found herself entering an invisible
doorway. She stumbled on the threshold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
flung out her free hand for support. She clutched
at a hand-rail that seemed to lead spirally upward.</p>

<p>Droop's voice came out of the blackness.</p>

<p>"Jest wait here a minute," he said. "I'll go up
an' turn on the light."</p>

<p>She heard him climbing a short flight of stairs, and
a few moments later a flood of light streamed from
a doorway above her head, amply lighting the little
hallway in which Rebecca was standing.</p>

<p>The hand-rail to which she was already clinging
skirted the iron stairs leading to the light, and she
started at once up this narrow spiral.</p>

<p>She was met at the door by Copernicus, who was
smiling with a proud complacency.</p>

<p>"Wal, Cousin Rebecca," he said, with a sweeping
gesture indicating their general surroundings, "what
d'ye think o' this?"</p>

<p>They were standing at the head of a sort of companion-way
in a roomy antechamber much resembling
the general cabin of a luxurious old-time sailing-packet.
The top of the stairs was placed between
two windows in one side wall of the machine, through
which there was just then entering a gentle breeze.
Two similar openings faced these in the opposite side
wall, and under each of the four windows there
was a long wooden bench carrying a flat mattress
cushion.</p>

<p>In the middle of the room, on a square deep-piled
rug, stood a table covered with a red cloth and surrounded
by three or four solid-looking upholstered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
chairs. Here were some books and papers, and directly
over the table a handsome electric chandelier
hung from the ceiling of dark-wood panels. This
was the source of their present illumination.</p>

<p>"This here's the settin'-room," Droop explained.
"An' these are the state-rooms&mdash;that's what he called
'em."</p>

<p>He walked toward two doors in one of the end
walls and, opening one of them, turned the switch of
the lamp within.</p>

<p>"'Lectric lights in it, like down to Keene," Rebecca
remarked, approaching the cabin and peering
in.</p>

<p>She saw a small bedroom comfortably furnished.
The carpet was apparently new, and on the tastefully
papered walls hung a number of small oil-paintings.</p>

<p>Droop opened the other door.</p>

<p>"They're both alike," he said.</p>

<p>Rebecca glanced into the second apartment, which
was indeed the counterpart of its companion.</p>

<p>"Well, it wouldn't do no harm to sweep an' beat
these carpets!" she exclaimed. Then, slipping her
forefinger gingerly over the edge of a chair: "Look
at that dust!" she said, severely, holding up her hand
for inspection.</p>

<p>But Droop had bustled off to another part of the
room.</p>

<p>"Here's lockers under these window-seats," he explained,
with a dignified wave of the hand. "Here's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
books an' maps in this set o' shelves. Here's a small
pianner that plays itself when you turn on the electricity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a stumbling crash and a suppressed cry
at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>With his heart in his mouth, Droop leaped to the
chandelier and turned out the lights; then rushed to
the state-rooms and was about to turn their switches
as well, when a familiar voice greeted their ears from
below&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't be scared&mdash;it's only Ph&oelig;be."</p>

<p>"What ever possessed&mdash;" began Rebecca, in a low
tone.</p>

<p>But at that moment Ph&oelig;be's head appeared over
the stair rail in the light shed from the two state-rooms.</p>

<p>"Won't you light up again, Mr. Droop?" she said,
merrily, smiling the while into her sister's crestfallen
face. "I heard you two leavin' the house, an' I just
guessed what you'd be up to. So I followed you
down here."</p>

<p>She dropped into one of the chairs beside the table
just as Droop relighted the lamps.</p>

<p>With one slender hand resting upon the table, she
looked up into Droop's face and went on:</p>

<p>"I was havin' a dreadful time, stumbling over
stocks an' stones at every step, till suddenly there was
quite a light struck my face, and first I knew I was
lookin' right into your lighted windows. I guess
we'll have a pleasant meetin' here of all the folks in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
town pretty soon&mdash;not to mention the skeeters,
which are comin' right early this year!"</p>

<p>"Lands sakes!" cried Rebecca.</p>

<p>"There now!" exclaimed Copernicus, bustling
toward the windows, "I must be a nateral born fool!"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be laughed in high spirits at thought of her
prank, while Droop closed the tight iron shutters at
each window, thus confining every ray of light.</p>

<p>Rebecca seated herself opposite Ph&oelig;be and looked
severely straight before her with her hands folded
in her lap. She was ashamed of her curiosity and
much chagrined at being discovered in this unconventional
situation by her younger sister.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be gazed about her and, having taken in the
general aspect of the antechamber in which they were
assembled, she explored the two state-rooms. Thence
she returned for a more detailed survey. Droop followed
her about explaining everything, but Rebecca
remained unmoved.</p>

<p>"What's all those dials on the wall, Mr. Droop?"
asked the younger sister.</p>

<p>"I wish't you'd call me Cousin Copernicus," said
Droop, appealingly.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be ran up very close to a large steel dial-plate
covered with figures.</p>

<p>"Now what the land is this for?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Thet," said Droop, slowly, "is an indicator of
height above ground and tells yer direction."</p>

<p>"And what d'ye do with this little handle?"</p>

<p>"Why, you set that for north or west or any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
way, an' the hull machine keeps headed that way
until ye change it."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that the rudder?"</p>

<p>"No, that is fer settin' jest one course fer a long
ride&mdash;like's ef we was goin' north to the pole, ye
know. The rudder's in here, 'long with the other
machinery."</p>

<p>He walked to one of the two doors which faced the
state-rooms.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be followed him and found herself in the presence
of a bewildering array of controlling and guiding
handles&mdash;gauges&mdash;test cocks&mdash;meters and indicators.
She was quite overawed, and listened with a
new respect for her distant relative as he explained
the uses of the various instruments. It was evident
that he had quite mastered the significance of each
implement.</p>

<p>When Droop had completed his lecture, Ph&oelig;be
found that she understood the uses of three of the
levers. The rest was a mystery to her.</p>

<p>"This is the starting-lever," she said. "This steers,
and this reverses. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"That's correct," said Droop, "an' if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She cut him short by whisking out of the room.</p>

<p>"What drives the thing?" she asked, as he meekly
followed her.</p>

<p>"Oh, the's power storage an' all kinds o' works
down below stairs."</p>

<p>"An' what's this room for?" she asked, opening the
door next the engine-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thet's the kitchen an' butler's pantry," said
Droop. "It's mighty finely fitted up, I tell ye. That
future-man was what ye call a conusure. My, but he
could cook up fine victuals!"</p>

<p>Rebecca found this temptation stronger than her
ill humor, and she rose with alacrity and followed her
companions into the now brightly lighted kitchen.</p>

<p>Here the appointments were the completest possible,
and, after she and Ph&oelig;be had mastered the
theory of the electric range, they agreed that they
had never seen such a satisfactory equipment.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be stood in the middle of the room and looked
about her with kindling eyes. The novelty of this
adventure had intoxicated her. Rebecca's enthusiasm
was repeated threefold in the more youthful bosom
of her sister.</p>

<p>"My!" she cried, "wouldn't it be lovely if we could
make this our house down here for a while! What
would the Mellicks an' the Tituses an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They'd take us for a lunatic asylum," Rebecca
exclaimed, severely.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be considered a moment and then gravely replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, I s'pose they would."</p>

<p>Copernicus was pacing slowly up and down from
range to china-closet and back, rubbing his hands
slowly over each other.</p>

<p>"I wish't you'd try to see ef ye couldn't change
yer mind, Cousin Ph&oelig;be," he said, earnestly. "Jest
think of all there is in this extrordnery vessel&mdash;what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
with kitchen an' little cunnin' state-rooms&mdash;what
with the hull machinery an' all&mdash;it's a sinful waste
to leave it all to rot away down in this here swamp
when we might all go back to the Centennial an'
get rich as&mdash;as Solomon's temple!"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be led the way in silence to the outer room
again, and Droop carefully extinguished the lights in
the kitchen and engine-room.</p>

<p>As the three stood together under the main chandelier
their faces were the exponents of three different
moods.</p>

<p>Droop was wistful&mdash;anxious.</p>

<p>Rebecca looked grimly regretful.</p>

<p>In Ph&oelig;be's eyes there shone a cheerful light&mdash;but
her expression was enigmatic.</p>

<p>"Now let's go home," she said, briskly. "I've
got somethin' that I want to talk to Rebecca about.
Can't you call in to-morrow mornin', Mr. Droop?"</p>

<p>"Don't ye believe ye might change yer mind?" he
asked, mournfully.</p>

<p>"We'll be through with the breakfast an' have
things set to rights by eight o'clock," said Ph&oelig;be.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">A NOCTURNAL EVASION</h3>


<p>Promptly at the appointed time, Copernicus Droop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
might have been seen approaching the white cottage.
Still nursing a faint hope, he walked with nervous
rapidity, mumbling and gesticulating in his excitement.
He attracted but little attention. His erratic
movements were credited to his usual potations, and
no one whom he passed even gave him a second
glance.</p>

<p>Nearing the house he saw Ph&oelig;be leaning out of
one of the second-story windows. She had been gazing
westward toward Burnham's swamp, but she
caught sight of Droop and nodded brightly to him.
Then she drew in her head and pulled down the window.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be opened the door as Copernicus entered the
garden gate, and it was at once apparent that her
buoyant mood was still upon her, for she actually
offered her hand to her visitor as he stood at the
threshold wiping his feet.</p>

<p>"Good mornin'," she said. "I've ben tryin' to see
if I could find the Panchronicon out of my window.
It's just wonderful how well it's hidden in the
bushes."</p>

<p>She led him to the parlor and offered him a seat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where's Cousin Rebecca?" he said, as he carefully
placed his hat on the floor beside his chair.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be seated herself opposite to her visitor with
her back to the windows, so that her face was in
shadow.</p>

<p>"Rebecca's upstairs," she replied.</p>

<p>Then, after a moment's pause: "She's packin' up,"
she said.</p>

<p>Droop straightened up excitedly.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;packin'!" he cried. "Hev ye decided ye'll
go, then?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Ph&oelig;be, slowly, "we have an'&mdash;an'
we haven't."</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Droop, it's just like this," she exclaimed,
leaning forward confidentially. "Ye see,
Rebecca an' I are both just plumb crazy to try that
wonderful plan of cuttin' meridians at the North
Pole&mdash;an' we're wild fer a ride on that queer kind
of a boat or whatever ye call it. At the same time,
Rebecca has to acknowledge that it's askin' too much
of me to go back to two years old an' live like a baby.
For one thing, I wouldn't have a thing to wear."</p>

<p>"But ye might make some clothes before ye start,"
Droop suggested.</p>

<p>"Mr. Droop!" Ph&oelig;be exclaimed, severely, "what
<i>do</i> you s'pose folks would say if Rebecca and I was to
set to work makin' baby clothes&mdash;two old maids like
us?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Droop looked down in confusion and plucked at
the edge of his coat.</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be Wise, you're only just tryin' to be smart
fer argument!"</p>

<p>This sentence was delivered with a suddenness
which was startling. Droop looked up with a jump
to find Rebecca standing at the door with a pile of
clean sheets on her arm.</p>

<p>She was gazing sternly at Ph&oelig;be, who appeared
somewhat disconcerted.</p>

<p>"You know's well's I do," continued the elder
sister, "that every one o' your baby clothes is folded
an' put away as good as new in the attic."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be rallied quickly and repelled this attack with
spirit.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care. They'll stay right where they
are, Rebecca," she answered, with irritation. "You
know we settled it last night that I wasn't to be pestered
about goin' back to 1876!"</p>

<p>"That's true," was the reply, "but don't you be
givin' such fool reasons for it. It's really just because
you're afraid o' bein' whipped an' put to bed&mdash;an'
goodness knows, you deserve it!"</p>

<p>With this, Rebecca turned grimly and went into
the garden to hang the sheets up for an airing.</p>

<p>There was a moment's awkward pause, and then
Ph&oelig;be broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Our plan's this, Mr. Droop," she said, "an' I hope
you'll agree. We want to have you take us to the
North Pole and unwind about six years. That'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
take us back before the World's Fair in Chicago,
when I was eighteen years old, an' we can see fer
ourselves how it feels to be livin' backward an' growin'
younger instead of older every minute."</p>

<p>"But what's the good of that?" Droop asked, querulously.
"I ain't goin' to do it jest fer fun. I'm
growin' too old to waste time that way. My plan
was to make money with all them inventions."</p>

<p>"Well, an' why can't ye?" she replied, coaxingly.
"There's that X-ray invention, now. Why couldn't
you show that at the World's Fair an' get a patent
fer it?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand that business," he replied,
sharply. "Besides I can't get one o' them X-ray machines&mdash;they
cost a heap."</p>

<p>This was a blow to Ph&oelig;be's plan and she fell
silent, thinking deeply. She had foreseen that Droop
would take only a mercenary view of the matter
and had relied upon the X-ray to provide him with
a motive. But if he refused this, what was she
to do?</p>

<p>Suddenly her face lighted up.</p>

<p>"I've got it!" she cried. "You know those movin'
picture boxes ye see down to Keene, where ye turn
a handle and a lot of photograph cards fly along like
rufflin' the leaves of a book. Why, it just makes
things look alive, Mr. Droop. I'm sure those weren't
thought of six years ago. They're span spinter new.
Why won't they do?"</p>

<p>"I ain't got one o' those either," Droop grumbled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
"I've got a kodak an' a graphophone an' a lot o' Milliken's
cough syrup with the recipe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why there!" cried Ph&oelig;be, exultantly. "Milliken's
cough syrup is only four years old, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Droop did not reply, but his silence was a virtual
assent.</p>

<p>"The's a mint o' money in that&mdash;you know there
is, Mr. Droop," she urged. "Why, I guess Mr. Milliken
must have two or three millions, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>Rebecca returned at this moment and seated herself
on the haircloth settle, nodding silently to Droop.</p>

<p>"What's about Mr. Milliken's money, Ph&oelig;be?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Why Mr. Droop says the X-ray is no good because
it costs a heap and he hasn't got a machine fer it&mdash;an'
I was tellin' him that Milliken's cough syrup was just
as good&mdash;for that wasn't invented six years ago,
an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be Wise, what do you mean!" exclaimed Rebecca.
"Why, it would be jest like robbery to take
Mr. Milliken's syrup, an' palm it off as Mr. Droop's.
I'm surprised at ye!"</p>

<p>This attack upon the ethical plane struck Ph&oelig;be
speechless. She blushed and stammered, but had no
reply to make. The seeming defeat really concealed
a victory, however, for it instantly converted Copernicus
into an ally.</p>

<p>"You don't understand the thing, Cousin Rebecca,"
he said, gently but firmly. "Ye see ef we
go six years back, it'll be a time when Mr. Milliken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
hadn't ever thought of his cough syrup. How could
we be robbin' him of somethin' he hasn't got?"</p>

<p>Rebecca looked confused for a moment, but was
not to be so easily convinced.</p>

<p>"'Tain't somethin' he ain't thought of," she said,
stoutly. "He's makin' money out of it, an' ef we
get back before him, why, when time comes agin for
him to invent it he won't have it to invent. I'm sure
that's jest as bad as robbin' him, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be looked anxiously at Copernicus and was
much pleased to find him apparently unmoved.</p>

<p>"Why, you certainly don't understand this yet," he
insisted. "Milliken ain't agoin' back six years with
us, is he? He'll jest go right along livin' as he's ben
doin'."</p>

<p>"What!" Rebecca exclaimed. "Will he be livin'
in one time an' we be livin' in another&mdash;both at the
same&mdash;" She stopped. What <i>was</i> she saying!</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no!" replied Copernicus. "He'll go on livin'.
That's what he <i>will</i> do. We'll go on havin'
lived. Or to put it different&mdash;we <i>have</i> gone on livin'
after we get back six years&mdash;to 1892. Ye see, we
really have past all the six years&mdash;so the's no harm
in it. Milliken won't be hurt."</p>

<p>Rebecca glanced at Ph&oelig;be, in whose face she
found her own perplexity reflected. Then, throwing
out her hands, as though pushing away her
crowding mental obstructions, she cried:</p>

<p>"There&mdash;there! I can't get the hang of it. It's
too much for me!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, when you've done it once it'll be all easy
and clear," said Droop, soothingly.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be looked hopefully into his face.</p>

<p>"Will you take us, Mr. Droop?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I s'pose I'll hev to."</p>

<p>"An' only unwind six years?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;jest six years."</p>

<p>She jumped up excitedly.</p>

<p>"Then I'll be off to my packin'!"</p>

<p>She ran to the door and, pausing here, turned again
to their visitor.</p>

<p>"Can we start to-night, Mr. Droop?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" he replied. "The sooner the better."</p>

<p>"That's splendid!" she cried, and ran quickly up
the stairs.</p>

<p>The two older people sat for a while in melancholy
silence, looking down. Each had hoped for more
than this. Copernicus tried to convince himself that
the profit from the cough syrup would comfort him
for his disappointment. Rebecca dismissed with a
sigh the dreams which she had allowed herself to entertain&mdash;those
bright fictions centering on Joe Chandler&mdash;not
the subdued old bachelor of 1898, but the jolly
young fellow of the famous Centennial year.</p>

<p>At length Rebecca looked up and said:</p>

<p>"After all, Mr. Droop, come to think of it, you've
no call to take us with ye. I can't do ye any good&mdash;goin'
back only six years."</p>

<p>"Yes ye can," said Droop. "I'll need somebody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to help me keep house in the Panchronicon. I ain't
no hand at cookin' an' all, an' besides, it'll be mighty
lonely without anybody in there."</p>

<p>"Well," she rejoined, rising, "I'll jest go up an'
finish my packin'."</p>

<p>"An' I'll go tend to mine."</p>

<p>As they parted at the front door, it was arranged
that Droop was to bring a wheelbarrow after supper
and transport the sisters' belongings, preparatory to
their departure.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was spent in preparation for
the momentous voyage. Ph&oelig;be went to the little
bank at Peltonville station and withdrew the entire
savings of herself and sister, much to the astonishment
and concern of the cashier. She walked all
the way to the bank and back alone, for it was obviously
necessary to avoid inconvenient questions.</p>

<p>When the two sisters stood in their little dining-room
with the heap of greenbacks on the table before
them, Rebecca was attacked by another conscientious
scruple.</p>

<p>"I don't hardly know as we're doin' right, Ph&oelig;be,"
she said, shaking her head dubiously. "When we
get back to 1892 we'd ought to find some money in
the bank already. Ef we hev this with us, too, seems
to me we'll hev more'n we're entitled to. Ain't it
a good deal like cheatin' the bank?"</p>

<p>"Mercy, no!" Ph&oelig;be exclaimed, pettishly. "You're
forever raisin' some trouble like that! Ain't this
our money?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then, what's the use o' talkin' 'bout it?
Just wait till we can mention your trouble to Mr.
Droop. He'll have a good answer for you."</p>

<p>"But s'posin' he can't answer it?" Rebecca insisted.</p>

<p>"Well, if he can't we can give back the difference
to the bank."</p>

<p>So saying, Ph&oelig;be took her share of the bills and
quickly left the room.</p>

<p>"I've got lots of things to do before night," she
remarked.</p>

<p>At promptly half-past nine all the lights in the
house were extinguished, and the two sisters sat together
in the dark parlor awaiting Copernicus. It
was Rebecca who had insisted on putting out the
lights.</p>

<p>"Ef folks was to see lights here so late in the
night," she said, "they'd suspicion somethin' an' they
might even call in."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be admitted the justness of this reasoning, and
they had both directed every endeavor to completing
all their arrangements before their accustomed
bed-time.</p>

<p>It was not long after this that a stealthy step was
heard on the gravel path and Ph&oelig;be hurried to the
door. Copernicus came in with a low word of greeting
and followed the ghostly shadow of his hostess
into the parlor.</p>

<p>The three stood together in the dark and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>versed
in an undertone, like so many conspirators
surrounded by spies.</p>

<p>"Hev ye got everythin' ready?" Droop asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ph&oelig;be. "The's only two little trunks
for you. Did you bring the wheelbarrow?"</p>

<p>"Yep&mdash;I left it outside the gate. 'Twould hev
made a lot of noise on the gravel inside."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Ph&oelig;be. "I guess you'll not
have any trouble to carry both o' those trunks at
once. We haven't packed only a few things, 'cause
I expect we'll find all our old duds ready for us in
1892, won't we?"</p>

<p>"Why, 'f course," said Droop.</p>

<p>"But how 'bout linen&mdash;sheets an' table-cloths an'
all?" said Rebecca. "We'll need some o' them on
the trip, won't we?"</p>

<p>"I've got a hull slew o' them things in the Panchronicon,"
said Copernicus. "Ye won't hev to
bother a bit about sech things."</p>

<p>"How long do you s'pose it'll take to make the
trip," asked Ph&oelig;be. "I mean by the clock? We
won't have to do any washing on the way, will we?"</p>

<p>"I don't see how we can," Rebecca broke in.
"The's not a blessed tub on the hull machine."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Droop, reassuringly. "We'll make
a bee-line for the pole, an' we'll go 'bout three times
as fast as a lightnin' express train. We'd ought to
reach there in about twenty-four hours, I guess.
Then we'll take it easy cuttin' meridians, so's not
to suffer from side weight, an'&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Side weight!" exclaimed the two women together.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Droop. "That's a complaint ye get
ef ye unwind the time too fast. Ye see, growin'
young isn't a thing folks is used to, an' it disgrummages
the hull constitution ef ye grow young too
fast. Well, 's I was a-sayin', I guess it'll take 'bout
eighteen hours by the clock to cut back six years.
Thet's by the clock, ye understand. As a matter
of fact, of course, we'll be just six years less'n no
time in finishin' the trip."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ph&oelig;be, briskly, "that's no kind o'
reason fer dawdlin' about it now. Let's be startin'."</p>

<p>"Where's the trunks?" said Droop.</p>

<p>The trunks were pointed out, and with very little
trouble Copernicus put them onto the barrow. He
then came to the door for his last instructions.</p>

<p>"'S anythin' more?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Rebecca. "We'll bring on our special
duds in our arms. We'll wait a spell an' come on
separate."</p>

<p>The door was carefully closed and they soon heard
the slight creak of the weighted wheel as Droop set
off with the trunks for Burnham's swamp.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said Ph&oelig;be, bustling into the parlor,
"let's get our things all together ready to start.
Have ye got your satchel with the money in it?"</p>

<p>Rebecca gently slapped a black leather bag hanging
at her side.</p>

<p>"Here 'tis," she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's see," Ph&oelig;be went on. "Here's my box with
the letters an' miniature, here's the box with the
jewelry, an' here's that book Mrs. Bolton gave me
about Bacon writin' Shakespeare."</p>

<p>"Whatever air ye takin' that old book fer,
Ph&oelig;be?"</p>

<p>"Why, to read on the train&mdash;I mean on the way,
ye know. We'll likely find it pretty pokey in that
one room all day."</p>

<p>"I don't know what ye mean by 'all day,'" Rebecca
exclaimed in a discouraged tone. "So far's I
see, th'ain't goin' to be any days. What'll it feel
like&mdash;livin' backward that way? D'ye guess it'll
make us feel sick, like ridin' backward in the cars?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me," Ph&oelig;be exclaimed, despairingly.
"'F I knew what 'twas like, perhaps I wouldn't feel
so like goin'."</p>

<p>She straightened herself suddenly and stood rigid.</p>

<p>"Hark!" she exclaimed. "Is that Mr. Droop comin'
back, d'you s'pose?"</p>

<p>There were distinctly audible footsteps on the
path.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be came out into the hall on tiptoe and stood
beside her sister.</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door. The two sisters
gripped each other's arms excitedly.</p>

<p>"'Taint Copernicus!" Rebecca whispered very
low.</p>

<p>The knock was repeated; rather louder this time.
Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Wise&mdash;Miss Wise&mdash;are ye to home?"</p>

<p>It was a woman's voice.</p>

<p>"Sarah Allen!" Ph&oelig;be exclaimed under her
breath.</p>

<p>"Whatever shall we do?" Rebecca replied.</p>

<p>"Miss Wise," the voice repeated, and then their
visitor knocked again, much more loudly.</p>

<p>"I'll go to the door," exclaimed Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I must. She'll raise the whole town if I don't."</p>

<p>So saying, Ph&oelig;be walked noisily to the door and
unlocked it.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mis' Allen?" she asked.</p>

<p>The door was opened, and Ph&oelig;be found herself
face to face with a short, light woman whose white
garments shone gray in the night.</p>

<p>"Why, you're up'n dressed!" exclaimed Mrs. Allen.
She did not offer to enter, but went on excitedly:</p>

<p>"Miss Ph&oelig;be," she said, "d'you know I b'lieve
you've ben robbed."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Yes; on'y a minute ago I was a-comin' up the
road from M'ria Payson's&mdash;you know she's right
sick an' I've ben givin' her massidge&mdash;an' what sh'd
I see but a man comin' out o' your gate with suthin'
on his shoulder. I couldn't see who 'twas, an' he was
so quiet an' sneaky without a light that I jest slipped
behind a tree. You know I've ben dreadful skeery
ever sence Tom was brought home with his arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
broke after a fight with a strange man in the dark.
Well, this man to-night he put the bundle or what
not into a wheelbarrow an' set off quiet as a mouse.
He went off down that way, an' says I to myself,
'It's a robber ben burglin' at the Wise's house,' says
I, an' I come straight here to see ef ye was both
murdered or what. Air ye all right? Hez he broken
yer door? Hev ye missed anythin'?"</p>

<p>As the little woman paused for breath, Ph&oelig;be
seized her opportunity.</p>

<p>"Did you say he went off to the north, Mis' Allen?"
she said, with feigned excitement.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear&mdash;oh, dear!" cried Ph&oelig;be, wringing her
hands. "Didn't I say I heard a noise&mdash;I told you I
heard a burglar, Rebecca," she went on, hysterically,
turning to her sister.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Rebecca there?" asked Mrs. Allen.</p>

<p>Rebecca came forward in silence. She was quite
nonplussed. To tell the truth, Ph&oelig;be's sudden outburst
was as great a tax upon her nerves as Mrs.
Allen's unwelcome visit. Surely Ph&oelig;be had said
nothing about a burglar! It was Droop that Mrs.
Allen had seen&mdash;of course it was. She dared not
say so in their visitor's presence, but she wondered
mightily at Ph&oelig;be's apparent perturbation.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be guessed her sister's mental confusion, and
she sought to draw Mrs. Allen's attention to herself
to avoid the betrayal of their plans which would certainly
follow Rebecca's joining the conversation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mis' Allen," she exclaimed, excitedly, "the's just
one thing to be done. Won't you run's quick's ever
you can to Si Pray, an' ask him to bring his gun?
You won't meet the burglar 'cause he's gone the
other way. Rebecca 'nd I'll jest wait here for you
an' Si. I'll get some hot water from the kitchen,
in case the burglar should come back while you're
gone. Oh, please will you do it?"</p>

<p>"Course I will," was the nervous reply. This hint
of the possible return of the robbers made an immediate
retreat seem very desirable. "I'll go right now.
Won't be gone a minute. Lock your door now&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>She turned and sped down the path. She had not
reached the gate before Ph&oelig;be walked rapidly into
the parlor.</p>

<p>"Quick&mdash;quick!" she panted, frantically gathering
up her belongings. "Get your duds an' come along."</p>

<p>"But what d'you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come&mdash;come&mdash;come!" cried Ph&oelig;be. "Come
quick or they'll all be here. Gun and all!"</p>

<p>With her arm full of bundles, Ph&oelig;be rushed back
through the hall and out of the front door. Rebecca
followed her, drawn along by the fiery momentum
of her sister.</p>

<p>"Lock the front door, Rebecca," Ph&oelig;be cried.
Then, as she reached the gate and found it fastened:
"Here, I can't undo the gate. My hands are full.
Oh, <i>do</i> hurry, Rebecca! We haven't a minute!"</p>

<p>The elder sister locked the front door and started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
down the path in such a nervous fever that she left
the key in the lock. Half way to the gate she paused.</p>

<p>"Come on&mdash;come on!" Ph&oelig;be cried, stamping her
foot.</p>

<p>"My land!" stammered Rebecca. "I've forgot
everythin'!" She started back, running with short,
unaccustomed steps.</p>

<p>"My umbrella!" she gasped. "My recipes&mdash;my
slips!"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was speechless with anger and apprehension
at this delay, and Rebecca was therefore allowed
to re-enter the house without objection.</p>

<p>In a short time she reappeared carrying an umbrella,
two flower-pots, and a folded newspaper.</p>

<p>"There!" she panted, as she came up to her sister
and opened the gate. "Now I guess I've got everythin'!"</p>

<p>Silently and swiftly the two women sped northward,
following the imaginary burglar, while the devoted
Mrs. Allen ran breathless in the opposite direction
for Si Pray and his gun.</p>

<p>"We'll hev to go more careful here," said Rebecca
as they turned into the lane leading down to
the swamp.</p>

<p>With many a stumble and some scratches they
moved more slowly down the rutted track until at
length they reached the point where they were to
turn into the swamp.</p>

<p>Here the sisters leaned against the wall to rest
and recover breath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"My goodness, but that was a narrow escape!"
murmured Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rebecca, with reproachful sadness;
"but I'm afraid you paid a heavy price fer it,
Ph&oelig;be!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, 's fur's I could make out, you told Mis' Allen
a deliberate wrong story, Ph&oelig;be Wise."</p>

<p>"What did I say?" said Ph&oelig;be, in shocked surprise.</p>

<p>"You said you hed told me you'd heerd a burglar!"</p>

<p>"Did I say that? Those very words?"</p>

<p>"Why, you know you did."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it a question, Rebecca?" Ph&oelig;be insisted.
"Didn't I <i>ask</i> you ef I hadn't told you I heard a
burglar?"</p>

<p>"No, it was a plain downright wrong story, Ph&oelig;be,
an' you needn't to try to sneak out of it."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was silent for a few moments, and then
Rebecca heard her laugh. It was a very little, rippling
thing&mdash;but it was genuine&mdash;there was real
light-heartedness behind it.</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be Wise!" exclaimed Rebecca, "how ken you
laugh so? I wouldn't hev the weight of sech a thing
on my mind fer a good deal."</p>

<p>"Well, Rebecca," tittered her sister, "I didn't have
it on my mind yesterday, did I?"</p>

<p>"Course not&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' won't it be yesterday for us mighty soon&mdash;yes,
an' a heap longer ago than that?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>She laughed again merrily and began to climb
over the wall, a proceeding not rendered easier by
the various articles in her hands.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the two women had joined
Copernicus within his mysterious machine and were
standing in the brightly lighted antechamber at the
head of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well!" cried Droop, as he caught sight of
the two women for the first time in the light.
"Where ever did ye get them funny dresses? Why,
your sleeves is all puffed out near the shoulders!"</p>

<p>"These are some of our old dresses," said Rebecca.
"They was made in 1891, an' we thought they'd
prob'bly be more in the fashion back in 1892 when
we get there than our newer dresses."</p>

<p>"Never mind our dresses, Mr. Droop," said Ph&oelig;be.
"Where can we put down all these things? My arms
are breakin' off."</p>

<p>"Right here, Cousin Ph&oelig;be."</p>

<p>Droop bustled over to the state-rooms, opening
both the doors at once.</p>

<p>"Here's a room apiece fer ye. Take yer choice."</p>

<p>"Oh, but where'll you sleep?" said Ph&oelig;be.
"P'raps Rebecca and I'd better have one room together."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said Droop. "I'll sleep on one
o' them settles under the windows. They're real
comfortable."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;just as you say."</p>

<p>The sisters entered their rooms and deposited their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
bundles, but Ph&oelig;be returned at once and called to
Droop, who had started down the stairs.</p>

<p>"Mr. Droop, you've got to start right straight off.
Mrs. Allen knows 't you've carried off the trunk and
she's comin' after us with Si Pray an' a gun."</p>

<p>Just then they heard the loud barking of a dog.
He was apparently running rapidly down the lane.</p>

<p>"Sakes alive!" cried Ph&oelig;be, in alarm. "Slam to
that door, Copernicus Droop! Si has let his dog
loose an' he's on your tracks!"</p>

<p>The baying was repeated&mdash;now much nearer.
Droop clattered frantically down the stairs, and shut
the door with a bang. At the next moment a heavy
body leaped against it, and a man's voice was heard
close at hand.</p>

<p>"Sic um, Touser, sic um! Where is he, boy?"</p>

<p>Up the stairs went Copernicus two steps at a time.
He dashed into the anteroom, pale and breathless.</p>

<p>"Lie down on the floor!" he shouted. "Lie down
or ye'll get throwed down. I'm agoin' to start her!"</p>

<p>By this time he had opened the engine-room door.</p>

<p>The two women promptly lay flat on their backs
on the carpet.</p>

<p>Droop braced himself firmly and had just grasped
the starting lever when a cry from Rebecca arrested
him.</p>

<p>"Copernicus Droop&mdash;hold on!" she cried.</p>

<p>He turned to her, his face full of anxious fear.
Rebecca lay on her back with her hands at her sides,
but her head was raised stiffly from the floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Copernicus Droop," she said, solemnly, "hev ye
brought any rum aboard with ye? 'Cause if ye have
I won't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She never concluded, for at this moment her head
was jerked back sharply against the floor by a tremendous
upward leap of the machine.</p>

<p>There was a hissing roar as of a thousand rockets,
and even as Rebecca was wondering, half stunned,
why she saw so many jumping lights, Si Pray gazed
open-mouthed at the ascension of a mysterious dark
body apparently aimed at the sky.</p>

<p>The Panchronicon had started.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">A CHANGE OF PLAN</h3>


<p>It was long after their bed-time and the two sisters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
were utterly exhausted; but as the mysterious
structure within which they lay glided northward
between heaven and earth with the speed of a
meteor, Rebecca and Ph&oelig;be long courted sleep in
vain.</p>

<p>The excitement of their past adventures, the unreal
wonder of their present situation, the bewildering
possibilities and impossibilities of their future
plans&mdash;all these conspired to banish sleep until long
past midnight. It was not until, speeding due north
with the unswerving obedience of a magnet, their
vessel was sailing far above the waters of the upper
Saguenay, that they at length sank to rest.</p>

<p>They were awakened next morning by a knocking
upon Rebecca's door.</p>

<p>"It's pretty nigh eight-thirty," Droop cried. "I've
got the kettle on the range, but I don't know what
to do nex'."</p>

<p>"What! Why! Who! Where! Sakes! what's
this?"</p>

<p>Rebecca sat up in bed, unable to place herself.</p>

<p>"It's pretty nigh half-past eight," Copernicus repeated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
"Long after breakfast-time. I'm hungry!"</p>

<p>By this time Ph&oelig;be was wide awake.</p>

<p>"All right!" she cried. "We'll come in a minute."</p>

<p>Then Rebecca knew where she was&mdash;or rather
realized that she did not know. But fortunately a
duty was awaiting her in the kitchen and this steadied
a mind which seemed to her to need some support
in the midst of these unwonted happenings.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was the first to leave her bedroom. She
had dressed with frantic speed. In her haste to get
to the windows and see the world from the sky, she
had secured her hair very imperfectly, and Droop
was favored with a charming display of bright locks,
picturesquely disarranged.</p>

<p>"Good-mornin', Cousin Ph&oelig;be," he said, with his
suavest manner.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Droop," Ph&oelig;be replied.
"Where are we? Is everything all right?"</p>

<p>She made straight for one of the windows the
iron shutters of which were now open.</p>

<p>"I wish't you'd call me Cousin Copernicus," Droop
remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh! What a beautiful world!"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be leaned her face close to the glass and gazed
spell-bound at the wonderful landscape spread before
her.</p>

<p>The whole atmosphere seemed filled with a clear,
cold sunlight whose brilliance irradiated the giant
sphere of earth so far away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Directly below and to the right of their course,
as far as she could see, there was one vast expanse
of dark blue sea, gilded dazzlingly over one portion
where the sun's beams were reflected. Far ahead to
the north and as far behind them the sea was bordered
with the fantastic curves of a faint blue coast
dotted and lined with the shadows of many a hill
and mountain. It was a map on which she was gazing.
Nature's own map&mdash;the only perfect chart in the
world.</p>

<p>So new&mdash;so intensely, almost painfully, beautiful
was this scene that Ph&oelig;be stood transfixed&mdash;fascinated.
She did not even think of speaking.</p>

<p>The scene was not so new to Droop&mdash;and besides
he was a prey to an insistent appetite. His mental
energies, therefore, sought expression in speech.</p>

<p>Approaching Ph&oelig;be's side, he said:</p>

<p>"Mighty pretty, ain't it?"</p>

<p>She did not reply, so he continued:</p>

<p>"That water right under us is Hudson Strait.
The ocean to the right is the Atlantic. Ye can see
Hudson's Bay off to the left out o' one o' them windows.
I've ben lookin' it up on the map."</p>

<p>He strolled toward the table, as if inviting Ph&oelig;be
to see his chart which lay there unrolled. She did
not follow him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued, "that's Hudson Strait, and
we're four miles high, an' that's all I'll tell ye till I
have my breakfast."</p>

<p>He gazed wistfully at Ph&oelig;be, who did not move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
or speak, but let her eyes wander in awed delight
over the wonders thus brought before them.</p>

<p>Just then Rebecca emerged from her room.</p>

<p>"Good-mornin'," she said. "I guess I'm late."</p>

<p>"Good-mornin', Cousin Rebecca; I guess ye are a
mite late. Cousin Ph&oelig;be won't move&mdash;so I'm sayin'
we're four miles high an' right over Hudson Strait,
an' that's all I'll tell ye till I get my breakfast."</p>

<p>"Goodness me!" exclaimed Rebecca. "Ain't that
mos' too high, Mr. Droop?" She hurried to the window
and looked out.</p>

<p>"Sakes alive!" she gasped.</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, awed in her turn by
the immensity of the prospect.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;but&mdash;it's all water underneath!" she exclaimed
at last. "Ef we was to fall now, we'd be
drowned!"</p>

<p>"Now don't you be a mite skeert," said Droop,
with reassuring politeness. "We've ben scootin'
along like this all night an'&mdash;an' the fact is, I've got
the kettle on&mdash;p'raps it's b'iled over."</p>

<p>Rebecca turned from the window at once and
made for the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be," she said, briskly, "you set the table now
an' I'll hev breakfast ready in a twinklin'."</p>

<p>Reluctantly Ph&oelig;be left the window and Droop
soon had the satisfaction of sauntering back and
forth between kitchen and dining-table in pleased
supervision of the progress of both.</p>

<p>In due time a simple but substantial breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
was in readiness, and the three travellers were seated
around the table partaking of the meal each in his
own way.</p>

<p>Droop was business-like, almost enthusiastic, in his
voracious hunger. Rebecca ate moderately and
without haste, precisely as though seated in the little
Peltonville cottage. Ph&oelig;be ate but little. She was
overcome by the wonders she had seen, realizing for
the first time the marvellous situation in which she
found herself.</p>

<p>It was not until the table was cleared and the two
women were busy with the dishes that conversation
was resumed. Droop sat with his chair tilted backward
against the kitchen wall enjoying a quiet satisfaction
with his lot and a kindly mental attitude
toward all men.</p>

<p>He glanced through the kitchen door at the barometer
on the wall in the outer room.</p>

<p>"We've climbed near a mile since before breakfast,"
he remarked.</p>

<p>Rebecca paused before hanging up the soap-shaker.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr. Droop," she said, anxiously, "we
are mos' too high a'ready, I think. S'posin' we was
to fall down. Where do you s'pose we'd be?"</p>

<p>"Why, Rebecca," said Ph&oelig;be, laughing, "do you
suppose five miles is any worse than four? I guess
we'd be killed by falling one mile jest as quick as
five."</p>

<p>"Quicker!" Droop exclaimed. "Considerable
quicker, Cousin Rebecca, fer it would take us a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
good deal longer to fall five miles than it would
one."</p>

<p>"But what ever's the use o' keepin' on a-climbin'?"</p>

<p>"Why, that's the nature of this machine," he replied.
"Ye see, it runs on the rocket principle by
spurtin' out gases. Ef we want to go up off the
ground we squirt out under the machine an' that
gives us a h'ist. Then, when we get 'way up high,
we spread out a pair o' big wings like and start the
propeller at the stern end o' the thing. Now them
wings on'y holds us up by bein' inclined a mite in
front, and consequence is we're mighty apt to climb
a little right 'long."</p>

<p>"Well, but won't we get too high?" suggested
Ph&oelig;be. "Ain't the air too thin up very high?"</p>

<p>"Of course, we mustn't go too high," Droop conceded,
"an' I was just a-thinkin' it wouldn't go amiss
to let down a spell."</p>

<p>He rose and started for the engine-room.</p>

<p>"How do you let down?" Ph&oelig;be asked, pausing
in her work.</p>

<p>"Why, I jest turn the wings horizontal, ye know,
an' then we sink very slow till I incline 'em up
again."</p>

<p>He disappeared. Ph&oelig;be gave the last of the dishes
a brief touch of the dish-towel and then ran into the
main room to watch the barometer.</p>

<p>She was much interested to observe a gradual but
continual decrease in their altitude. She walked to
the window but could see no apparent change, save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
that they had now passed the sea and only the blue
land with silver streaks of river and indigo hill shadows
was beneath them.</p>

<p>"How fast do you s'pose we're flyin', Mr. Droop?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"There's the speed indicator," he said, pointing to
one of the dials on the wall. "Ye see it says we're
a-hummin' along at about one hundred an' thirty
miles an hour."</p>

<p>"My gracious!" cried Ph&oelig;be. "What if we was
to hit something!"</p>

<p>"Nothin' to hit," said Droop, with a smile. "Ye
see, the's no sort o' use goin' any slower, an' besides,
this quick travellin' keeps us warm."</p>

<p>"Why, how's that?"</p>

<p>"The sides o' the machine rubbin' on the air," said
Droop.</p>

<p>"That's so," Ph&oelig;be replied. "That's what heats
up meteors so awful hot, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Rebecca came out of the kitchen at this moment.</p>

<p>"I must say ye wasn't particler about gettin' all
the pans to rights 'fore ye left the kitchen, Ph&oelig;be.
Ben makin' the beds?"</p>

<p>"Land, no, Rebecca!" said Ph&oelig;be, blushing guiltily.</p>

<p>"Well, there!"</p>

<p>Rebecca said no more, but her set lips and puckered
forehead spoke much of displeasure as she
stalked across to the state-rooms.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare to goodness!" she cried, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
opened her door. "Ye hevn't even opened the window
to air the rooms!"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be looked quite miserable at thought of her
remissness, but Copernicus came bravely to the
rescue.</p>

<p>"The windows can't be opened, Cousin Rebecca,"
he said. "Ef ye was to open one, 'twould blow yer
head's bald as an egg in a minute."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ph&oelig;be, briskly, "I couldn't air the
beds an' make 'em because we're going one hundred
and thirty odd miles an hour, Rebecca."</p>

<p>"D'you mean to tell me, Copernicus Droop," cried
the outraged spinster, "that I've got to go 'thout
airin' my bed?"</p>

<p>"No, no," Copernicus said, soothingly. "The's
special arrangements to keep ventilation goin'. Jest
leave the bed open half the day an' it'll be all
aired."</p>

<p>Rebecca looked far from pleased at this.</p>

<p>"I declare, ef I'd known of all these doin's," she
muttered.</p>

<p>Unable to remain idle, she set to work "putting
things to rights," as she called it, while Ph&oelig;be took
her book to the west window and was soon lost in
certain modern theories concerning the Baconian
authorship of Shakespeare's works.</p>

<p>"Is these duds yourn, Mr. Droop?" asked Rebecca,
sharply, pointing to a motley collection of goods piled
in one corner of the main room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," Droop replied, coming quickly to her side.
"Them's some of the inventions I'm carryin' along."</p>

<p>He stooped and gathered up a number of boxes
and bundles in his arms. Then he stood up and
looked about him as though seeking a safe place for
their deposit.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Rebecca. "Ye can put 'em
right back, Mr. Droop. I jest wanted to see whether
the' was much dust back in there."</p>

<p>Droop replaced his goods with a sigh of relief.
One box he retained, however, and, placing it upon
the table, proceeded to unpack it.</p>

<p>Rebecca now turned her attention to her own belongings.
Lifting one of her precious flower-pots
carefully, she looked all about for a more suitable
location for her plants.</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be," she exclaimed at length, "where ever
can I set my slips? They ought to be in the sun
there by the east window, but it'll dirt up the coverin'
of the settle."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be looked up from her book.</p>

<p>"Why don't ye spread out that newspaper you
brought with you?" she said.</p>

<p>Rebecca shook her head.</p>

<p>"No," she replied, "I couldn't do thet. The's a
lot o' fine recipes in there&mdash;I never could make my
sweet pickle as good as thet recipe in the New York
paper thet Molly sent me."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be laid down her book and walked over to her
sister's side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, the' must be some part of it you can use,
Rebecca," she said. "Land sakes!" she continued,
laughing. "Why, it's the whole of the <i>New York
World</i> for a Sunday&mdash;pictures an' all! Here&mdash;take
this advertisin' piece an' spread it out&mdash;so."</p>

<p>She tore off a portion of the voluminous paper
and carefully spread it out on one of the eastern
settles.</p>

<p>"Whatever did you bring those slips with you for?"
she asked.</p>

<p>Rebecca deposited the flower-pots carefully in the
sun and slapped her hands across each other to remove
the dust on them.</p>

<p>"One o' them is off my best honeysuckle thet come
from a slip thet Sam Mellick brought from Japan
in 1894. This geranium come off a plant thet was
given me by Arabella Slade, 'fore she died in 1896,
an' she cut it off'n a geranium thet come from a lot
thet Joe Chandler's father raised from slips cut off
of some plants down to Boston in the ground that
used to belong to our great-grandfather Wilkins 'fore
the Revolution."</p>

<p>This train of reasoning seemed satisfactory, and
Ph&oelig;be turned to resume her book.</p>

<p>Copernicus intercepted her as she passed the table.</p>

<p>"What d'ye think o' this little phonograph, Cousin
Ph&oelig;be?" he said.</p>

<p>One of Droop's boxes stood open and beside it
Ph&oelig;be saw a phonograph with the usual spring motor
and brass megaphone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"I paid twenty-five fer that, secon' hand, down to
Keene," said the proud owner.</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed Ph&oelig;be. "I've always wanted
to know how those things worked. I've heard 'em,
you know, but I've never worked one."</p>

<p>"It's real easy," said Droop, quite delighted to
find Ph&oelig;be so interested. "Ye see, when it's wound
up, all ye hev to do is to slip one o' these wax cylinders
on here&mdash;so."</p>

<p>He adjusted the cylinder, dropped the stylus and
pushed the starting lever.</p>

<p>Instantly the stentorian announcement rang out
from the megaphone.</p>

<p>"The Last Rose of Summer&mdash;Sola&mdash;Sung by Signora
Casta Diva&mdash;Edison Record!"</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious sakes alive!" cried Rebecca,
turning in affright. "Who's that?"</p>

<p>Her two companions raised their right hands in a
simultaneous appeal for silence. Then the song began.</p>

<p>With open eyes and mouth, the amazed Rebecca
drew slowly nearer, and finally took her stand directly
in front of the megaphone.</p>

<p>The song ended and Copernicus stopped the motor.</p>

<p>"Oh, ain't it lovely!" Ph&oelig;be cried.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I'll&mdash;be&mdash;switched!" Rebecca exclaimed,
with slow emphasis. "Can it sing anythin' else?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you never hear one afore, Cousin Rebecca?"
Droop asked.</p>

<p>"I never did," she replied. "What on the face
of the green airth does it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have ye any funny ones?" Ph&oelig;be asked, quickly,
fearful of receiving a long scientific lecture.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Droop. "Here's a nigger minstrels.
The's some jokes in it."</p>

<p>The loud preliminary announcement made Rebecca
jump again, but while the music and the songs
and jokes were delivered, she stood earnestly attentive
throughout, while her companions grinned and
giggled alternately.</p>

<p>"Is thet all?" she asked at the conclusion.</p>

<p>"Thet's all," said Droop, as he removed the cylinder.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see nothin' funny 'bout it," she said,
plaintively.</p>

<p>Droop's pride was touched.</p>

<p>"Ah, but that ain't all it can do!" he cried. "Here's
a blank cylinder. You jest talk at the machine while
it's runnin', an' it'll talk back all you say."</p>

<p>This was too much for Rebecca's credulity, and
Droop could not induce her to talk into the trumpet.</p>

<p>"You can't make a fool o' me, Copernicus Droop,"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You try, Cousin Ph&oelig;be," he said at last.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be looked dubiously at her sister as though
half of opinion that her shrewd example should be
followed.</p>

<p>"You sure it'll do it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Certain!" cried Copernicus, nodding his head
with violence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>She stood a moment leaning over with her pretty
lips close to the trumpet.</p>

<p>Then she straightened up with a face of comical
despair.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Droop stopped the motor and looked about the
room. Suddenly his eyes brightened.</p>

<p>"There," he cried, pointing to the book Ph&oelig;be
had been reading, "read suthin' out o' that into
it."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be opened the book at random, and as Droop
started the motor again she read the following lines
slowly and distinctly into the trumpet:</p>

<p>"It is thus made clear from the indubitable evidence
of the plays themselves that Francis Bacon
wrote the immortal works falsely ascribed to William
Shakespeare, and that the gigantic genius of this
man was the result of the possession of royal blood.
In this unacknowledged son of Elizabeth Tudor,
Queen of England, was made manifest to all countries
and for all centuries the glorious powers inherent
in the regal blood of England."</p>

<p>"That'll do," said Droop. "Now jest hear it talk
back."</p>

<p>He substituted the repeating stylus for the recording
point and set the motor in motion once more.
To the complete stupefaction of Rebecca, the repetition
of Ph&oelig;be's words was perfect.</p>

<p>"Why! It's Ph&oelig;be's voice," she began, but Ph&oelig;be
broke in upon her suddenly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, see the hills on each side of us, Mr. Droop,"
she cried.</p>

<p>Droop glanced out and leaped a foot from the
ground.</p>

<p>"Goramighty!" he screamed, "she'll strike!" He
dashed to the engine-room and threw up the forward
edges of the aeroplanes. Instantly the vessel swooped
upward and the hills Ph&oelig;be had seen appeared to
drop into some great abyss.</p>

<p>The two women ran to a window and saw that
they were over a bleak and rocky island covered with
ice and snow.</p>

<p>Droop came to their side, quite pale with fright.</p>

<p>"Great Moses!" he exclaimed. "I warn't more'n
jest in time, I tell ye! We was a-settlin' fast. A
little more'n we'd ha' struck&mdash;" He snapped the
fingers of both hands and made a gesture expressive
of the complete destruction which would have resulted.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, Mr. Droop," said Rebecca, sternly,
but with a little shake in her voice, "you've got
to jest tend to business and navigate this thing we're
a-ridin' on. You can't work and play too. Don't
you say anythin' more to Ph&oelig;be or me till we get
to the pole. What time'll that be?"</p>

<p>"About six or half-past, I expect," said Droop,
humbly. "But I don't see how I can be workin' all
the time. The machine don't need it, an', besides,
I've got to eat, haven't I?"</p>

<p>"When it comes time fer your victuals, Ph&oelig;be'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
watch the windows an' the little clocks on the wall
while I feed ye. But don't open yer head agin now,
only fer necessary talkin' an' eatin', till we get there.
I don't want any smash-ups 'round here."</p>

<p>Copernicus found it expedient to obey these instructions,
and under Rebecca's watchful generalship
he was obliged to pace back and forth from engine-room
to window while Ph&oelig;be read and her sister
knitted. So passed the remainder of the day, save
when at dinner-time the famished man was relieved
by his young lieutenant.</p>

<p>Immediately after supper, however, they all three
posted themselves at the windows, on the lookout for
the North Pole. Droop slowed down the propeller,
and the aeroplanes being thus rendered less effective
they slowly descended.</p>

<p>They were passing over an endless plain of rough
and ragged ice. In every direction all the way to
the horizon nothing could be seen but the glare of
white.</p>

<p>"How'll you know when we get there?" asked
Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>Droop glanced apprehensively at Rebecca and replied
in a whisper:</p>

<p>"We'll see the pole a-stickin' up. We can't go
wrong, you know. The Panchronicon is fixed to
guide itself allus due north."</p>

<p>"You don't need to whisper&mdash;speak right up, Mr.
Droop," said Rebecca, sharply.</p>

<p>Copernicus started, looked nervously about and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
then stared out of the window northward with a very
business-like frown.</p>

<p>"Is the' really an' truly a pole there?" Ph&oelig;be asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Droop, shortly.</p>

<p>"An' can ye see the meridians jammed together
like in the geographies?" asked Rebecca.</p>

<p>"No," said Droop, "no, indeed&mdash;at least, I didn't
see any."</p>

<p>"Why, Rebecca," said Ph&oelig;be, "the meridians are
only conventional signs, you know. They don't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hallo!" Droop cried, suddenly, "what's that?"
He raised a spyglass with which he had hitherto been
playing and directed it northward for a few seconds.
Then he turned with a look of relief on his face.</p>

<p>"It's the pole!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be snatched the spyglass and applied it to her
eye.</p>

<p>Yes, on the horizon she could discern a thin black
line, rising vertically from the plain of ice. Even
as she looked it seemed to be nearer, so rapid was
their progress.</p>

<p>Droop went to the engine-room, lessened speed
and brought the aeroplanes to the horizontal. He
could look directly forward through a thick glass port
directly over the starting-handle. Gradually the
great machine settled lower and lower. It was now
running quite slowly and the aeroplanes acted only
as parachutes as they glided still forward toward the
black upright line.</p>

<p>In silence the three waited for the approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
end of this first stage of their journey. A few hundred
yards south of their goal they seemed about to
alight, but Droop slightly inclined the aeroplanes
and speeded up the propeller a little. Their vessel
swept gently upward and northward again, like a
gull rising from the sea. Then Droop let it settle
again. Just as they were about to fall rather violently
upon the solid mass of ice below them, he
projected a relatively small volume of gas from beneath
the structure. Its reaction eased their descent,
and they settled down without noise or shock.</p>

<p>They had arrived!</p>

<p>Copernicus came forward to the window and
pointed to a tall, stout steel pole projecting from the
ice a few yards to the right of the vessel.</p>

<p>"Thet, neighbors, is the North Pole!" he said, with
a sweeping wave of the hand.</p>

<p>For some minutes the three voyagers stood in silence
gazing through the window at the famous pole.
This, then, was the goal of so much heroic endeavor!
It was to reach this complete opposite of all
that is ordinarily attractive that countless ambitious
men had suffered&mdash;that so many had died!</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed Rebecca at length. "I be
switched ef I see what there is fer so many folks to
make sech a fuss about!"</p>

<p>Droop scratched his head thoughtfully and made
no reply. Surely it would have been hard to point
out any charms in the endless plain of opaque ice
hummocks, unrelieved save by that gaunt steel pole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where's the open sea?" Rebecca asked, after a
few moments' pause. "Dr. Kane said the' was an
open sea up here."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dr. Kane!" said Droop, contemptuously.
"He's no 'count fer modern facts."</p>

<p>"What I can't understand," said Ph&oelig;be, "is how
it comes that, if nobody's ever been up here, they
all seem to know there's a North Pole here."</p>

<p>"That's a fact," Rebecca exclaimed. "How'd they
know about it? The' ain't anythin' in the Bible 'bout
it, is the'?"</p>

<p>Droop looked more cheerful at this and answered
briskly:</p>

<p>"Oh, they don't know 'bout it. Ye see, that pole
there ain't a nat'ral product of the soil at all. Et's
the future man done that&mdash;the man who invented
this Panchronicon and brought me up here before.
He told me how that he stuck that post in there to
help him run this machine 'round and 'round fer
cuttin' meridians."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed both sisters together.</p>

<p>"Yes," Droop continued. "D'ye see thet big iron
ring 'round the pole, lyin' on the ground?"</p>

<p>"I don't see any ground," said Rebecca, ruefully.</p>

<p>"Well, on the ice, then. Don't ye see it lyin'
black there against the snow?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, I see it," said Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>"Well, that's what I'm goin' to hitch the holdin'
rope on to. You'll see how it's done presently."</p>

<p>He glanced at the clock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Seven o'clock," he said. "I guessed mighty close
when I said 'twould take us twenty hours. We left
Peltonville at ten-thirty last night."</p>

<p>"Seven o'clock!" cried Rebecca. "So 'tis. Why,
what's the matter with the sun. Ain't it goin' to
set at all?"</p>

<p>"Not much!" said Droop, chuckling. "Sun don't
set up here, Cousin Rebecca. Not until winter-time,
an' then et stays set till summer again."</p>

<p>"Well!" was the breathless reply. "An' where in
creation does it go when it stays set?"</p>

<p>"Why, Rebecca," exclaimed Ph&oelig;be, "the sun is
south of the equator in winter, you know."</p>

<p>"Shinin' on the South Pole then," Droop added,
nodding.</p>

<p>For a moment Rebecca looked from one to the
other of her companions, and then, realizing the necessity
of keeping her mind within its accustomed
sphere, she changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Come now&mdash;the' ain't any wind to blow us away
now, I hope. Let's open our windows an' air out
those state-rooms."</p>

<p>She started toward her door.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" cried Droop, extending his arm to stop
her. "You don't want to fall down dead o' cold,
do ye?"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Don't you know what a North Pole is like fer
weather an' sich?" Droop continued. "Why, Cousin
Rebecca, it's mos' any 'mount below zero outside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Don't you open a window&mdash;not a tiny crack&mdash;if ye
don't want to freeze solid in a second."</p>

<p>"There!" Rebecca exclaimed. "You do provoke
me beyond anythin', Copernicus Droop! Ef I'd
a-knowed the kind o' way we'd had to live&mdash;why,
there! It's wuss'n pigs!"</p>

<p>She marched indignantly into her room and closed
the door. A moment later she put out her head.</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be Wise," she said, "if you take my advice,
you'll make your bed an' tidy yer room at once.
Ain't any use waitin' any longer fer a chance to
air."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be smiled and moved toward her own door.</p>

<p>"Thet's a good idea," said Droop. "You fix yer
rooms an' I'll do some figurin'. Ye see I've got to
figure out how long it'll take us to get back six years.
I've a notion it'll take about eighteen hours, but I
ain't certain sure."</p>

<p>Poor Rebecca set to work in her rooms with far
from enviable feelings. Her curiosity had been
largely satisfied and the unwonted conditions were
proving very trying indeed. Could she have set out
with the prospect of returning to those magical days
of youth and courtship, as Droop had originally proposed,
the end would have justified the means. But
they could not do this now if they would, for Ph&oelig;be
had left her baby clothes behind. Thus her disappointment
added to her burdens, and she found herself
wishing that she had never left her comfortable
home, however amazing had been her adventures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"I could'v aired my bed at least," she muttered,
as she turned the mattress of her couch in the solitude
of her chamber.</p>

<p>She found the long-accustomed details of chamber
work a comfort and solace, and, as she finally
gazed about the tidy room at her completed work,
she felt far more contented with her lot than she
had felt before beginning.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go help Ph&oelig;be," she thought. "The
girl is that slow!"</p>

<p>As she came from her room she found Copernicus
leaning over the table, one hand buried in his hair
and the other wielding a pencil. He was absorbed
in arithmetical calculations.</p>

<p>She did not disturb him, but turned and entered
Ph&oelig;be's room without the formality of knocking.
As she opened the door, there was a sharp clatter,
as of a door or lid slamming.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" cried Ph&oelig;be, sharply.</p>

<p>She was seated on the floor in front of her trunk,
and she looked up at her sister with a flushed and
startled face.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you!" she said, guiltily.</p>

<p>Rebecca glanced at the bed.</p>

<p>It had not been touched.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" Rebecca exclaimed. "Ain't
you ever agoin' to fix up your room, Ph&oelig;be
Wise?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in a minute, Rebecca. I was just agoin' over
my trunk a minute."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>She leaned back against the foot of the bed, and
folding her hands gazed pensively into vacancy, while
Rebecca stared at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Do you know," Ph&oelig;be went on, "I've ben thinkin'
it's awful mean not to give you a chance to go
back to 1876, Rebecca. Joe Chandler's a mighty
fine man!"</p>

<p>Rebecca gave vent to an unintelligible murmur
and turned to Ph&oelig;be's bed. She grasped the mattress
and gave it a vicious shake as she turned it over.
She was probably only transferring to this inoffensive
article a process which she would gladly have
applied elsewhere.</p>

<p>There was a long silence while Rebecca resentfully
drew the sheets into proper position, smoothed
them with swift pats and caressings, and tucked them
neatly under at head and sides. Then came a soft,
apologetic voice.</p>

<p>"Rebecca!"</p>

<p>The spinster made no reply but applied herself to
a mathematically accurate adjustment of the top
edge of the upper sheet.</p>

<p>"Rebecca!"</p>

<p>The second call was a little louder than the first,
and there was a queer half-sobbing, half-laughing
catch in the speaker's voice that commanded attention.</p>

<p>Rebecca looked up.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was still sitting on the floor beside her
trunk, but the trunk was open now and the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
woman's rosy face was peering with a pathetic smile
over a&mdash;what!&mdash;could it be!</p>

<p>Rebecca leaned forward in amazement.</p>

<p>Yes, it was! In Ph&oelig;be's outstretched hands was
the dearest possible little baby's undergarment&mdash;all
of cambric, with narrow ribbons at the neck.</p>

<p>For a few seconds the two sisters looked at each
other over this unexpected barrier. Then Ph&oelig;be's
lips quivered into a pathetic curve and she buried
her face in the little garment, laughing and crying
at once.</p>

<p>Rebecca dropped helplessly into a chair.</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be Martin Wise!" she exclaimed. "Do you
mean&mdash;hev you brought&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>She fell silent, and then, darting at her sister, she
took her head in her hands and deposited a sudden
kiss on the smooth bright gold-brown hair and
whisked out of Ph&oelig;be's room and into her own.</p>

<p>In the meantime Copernicus was too deeply absorbed
in his calculations to notice these comings and
goings. Apparently he had been led into the most
abstruse mathematical regions. Nothing short of
the triple integration of transcendental functions
should have been adequate to produce those lines
of anxious care in his face as he slowly covered sheet
after sheet with figures.</p>

<p>He was at length startled from his preoccupation
by a gentle voice at his side.</p>

<p>"Can't I help, Mr. Droop?"</p>

<p>It was Ph&oelig;be, who, having made all right in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
room and washed all traces of tears from her face,
had come to note Droop's progress.</p>

<p>Dazed, he raised his head and looked unexpectedly
into a lovely face made the more attractive by
an expression only given by a sense of duty unselfishly
done.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wish'd you'd call me Cousin Copernicus,"
he said for the fifth time.</p>

<p>She picked up one of the sheets on which he had
been scribbling as though she had not heard him,
and said:</p>

<p>"Why, dear me! How comes it you have so much
figurin' to do?"</p>

<p>"Well," he began, in a querulous tone, "it beats
all creation how many things a feller has to work
out at once! Ye see, I've got a rope forty foot long
that's got to tie the Panchronicon to the North Pole
while we swing 'round to cut meridians. Now, then,
the question is, How many times an hour shall we
swing 'round to get to 1892, an' how long's it goin'
to take an' how fast must I make the old thing hum
along?"</p>

<p>"But you said eighteen hours by the clock would
do it."</p>

<p>"Well, I jest guessed at that by the time the future
man an' I took to go back five weeks, ye know.
But I can't seem to figur it out right."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be seated herself at the table and took up a
blank sheet of paper.</p>

<p>"Please lend me your pencil," she said. "Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
then, every time you whirl once 'round the pole to
westward you lose one day, don't you?"</p>

<p>"That's it," said Droop, cheerfully. "Cuttin'
twenty-four meridians&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And how many days in twenty-two years?" Ph&oelig;be
broke in.</p>

<p>"You mean in six years."</p>

<p>"Why, no," she replied, glancing at Droop with
a mischievous smile, "it's twenty-two years back to
1876, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"To '76&mdash;why, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He caught sight of her face and stopped short.</p>

<p>There came a pleased voice from one of the state-rooms.</p>

<p>"Yes, we've decided to go all the way back, Mr.
Droop."</p>

<p>It was Rebecca.</p>

<p>She came forward and stood beside her sister,
placing one hand affectionately upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>Droop leaned back in his chair with both hands
on the edge of the table.</p>

<p>"Goin' all the way! Why, but then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He leaped to his feet with a radiant face.</p>

<p>"Great Jumpin' Jerusha!" he cried.</p>

<p>Slapping his thigh he began to pace excitedly up
and down.</p>

<p>"Why, then, we'll get all the big inventions out&mdash;kodak
an' phonograph and all. We'll marry Joe
Chandler an' set things agoin' in two shakes fer millions."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eight thousand and thirty-five," said Ph&oelig;be in
a quiet voice, putting her pencil to her lips. "We'll
have to whirl round the pole eight thousand and
thirty-five times."</p>

<p>"Whose goin' to keep count?" asked Rebecca,
cheerfully. Ah, how different it all seemed now!
Every dry detail was of interest.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be looked up at Droop, who now resumed his
seat, somewhat sobered.</p>

<p>"Don't have to keep count," he replied. "See
that indicator?" he continued, pointing to a dial in
the ceiling which had not been noticed before. "That
reads May 3, 1898, now, don't it? Well, it's fixed
to keep always tellin' the right date. It counts the
whirls we make an' keeps tabs on every day we go
backward. Any time all ye hev to do is to read that
thing an' it'll tell ye jest what day 'tis."</p>

<p>"Then what do you want to calculate how often
to whirl round?" asked Ph&oelig;be, in disgusted tones.</p>

<p>"Well, ye see I want to plan out how long it'll
take," Droop replied. "I want to go slow so as to
avoid side weight&mdash;but I don't want to go too slow."</p>

<p>"I see," said Ph&oelig;be. "Well, then, how many
times a minute did the future man take you when
you whirled back five weeks?"</p>

<p>"'Bout two times a minute."</p>

<p>"That's one hundred and twenty times every hour.
Did you feel much side weight then?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely any."</p>

<p>"Well, let's see. Divide eight thousand and thir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>ty-five
whirls by one hundred and twenty, an' you
get sixty-seven hours. So that, ef we go at that rate
it'll be two days and nineteen hours 'fore we get
back to 1876."</p>

<p>"Don't talk about days," Droop objected. "It's
sixty-seven hours by the clock&mdash;but it's twenty-two
years less than no time in days, ye know."</p>

<p>"Sixty-seven hours," said Ph&oelig;be. "Well, that
ain't so bad, is it? Why not go round twice a minute?"</p>

<p>"We can't air our beds fer three days, Ph&oelig;be,"
said Rebecca.</p>

<p>"But if we go much faster, we'll all be sick with
this side weight trouble that Mr. Droop tells
about."</p>

<p>"I vote fer twice a minute," said Droop. And so
twice a minute was adopted.</p>

<p>"Air ye goin' to start to-night, Mr. Droop?" asked
Rebecca.</p>

<p>"Well, no," he replied. "I think it's best to wait
till to-morrow. Ye see, the power that runs the
Panchronicon is got out o' the sunlight that falls on
it. Of course, we're not all run out o' power by a
good lot, but we've used considerable, an' I think
it's a little mite safer to lie still fer a few hours here
an' take in power from the sun. Ye see, it'll shine
steady on us all night, an' we'll store up enough
power to be sure o' reachin' 1876 in one clip."</p>

<p>"Well," said Rebecca, "ef thet's the plan, I'm goin'
to bed right now. It's after eight o'clock, an' I didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
get to sleep las' night till goodness knows when.
Good-night! Hedn't you better go, too, Ph&oelig;be?"</p>

<p>"I guess I will," said Ph&oelig;be, turning to Copernicus.
"Good-night, Mr. Droop."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Cousin Ph&oelig;be&mdash;good-night, Cousin
Rebecca. I'll go to bed myself, I b'lieve."</p>

<p>The two doors were closed and Droop proceeded
to draw the steel shutters in order to produce artificially
the gloom not vouchsafed by a too-persistent
sun.</p>

<p>In half an hour all were asleep within the now
motionless conveyance.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">DROOP'S THEORY IN PRACTICE</h3>


<p>All were up betimes when the faithful clock announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
that it ought to be morning. As for the
sun, as though resenting the liberties about to be
taken by these adventurers with its normal functions,
it refused to set, and was found by the three travellers
at the same altitude as the night before.</p>

<p>Promptly after breakfast Droop proceeded to don
a suit of furs which he drew from a cupboard within
the engine-room.</p>

<p>"Ye'd better hev suthin' hot ready when I come in
again," he said. "I 'xpect I'll be nigh froze to death."</p>

<p>He drew on a huge cap of bear's fur which extended
from his crown to his shoulders. There was
a small hole in front which exposed only his nose
and eyes.</p>

<p>"My, but you do look just like a pictur of Kris
Kringle!" laughed Ph&oelig;be. "Don't he, Rebecca?"</p>

<p>Rebecca came to the kitchen door wiping a dish
with slow circular movements of her towel.</p>

<p>"I don't guess you'll freeze very much with all
that on," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Thet shows you don't know what seventy or eighty
below zero means," said a muffled voice from within
the fur cap. "You'll hev suthin' hot, won't ye?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Droop continued, looking appealingly at Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>"The'll be a pot o' good hot tea," she said. "That'll
warm you all right."</p>

<p>Droop thought of something more stimulating and
fragrant, but said nothing as he returned to the cupboard.
Here he drew forth an apparently endless
piece of stout rope. This he wound in a thick coil
and hung over his head.</p>

<p>"Now, then," he said, "when I get down you shet
the door at the top of the stairs tight, coz jest's soon's
I open the outside door, thet hall's goin' to freeze
up solid."</p>

<p>"All right!" said Ph&oelig;be. "I'll see to it."</p>

<p>Droop descended the stairs with a heavy tread,
and as he reached the foot Ph&oelig;be closed the upper
door, which she now noticed was provided with
weather-strips.</p>

<p>Then the two women stood at the windows on the
right-hand side of the vessel and watched Droop as
he walked toward the pole. He raised the huge iron
ring, snapping over it a special coupling hook fixed
to the end of the rope.</p>

<p>Then he backed toward the vessel, unrolling the
coil of rope as he moved away from the pole. Evidently
they were within the forty-foot limit from
the pole, for Droop had some rope to spare when
he at length reached under the machine to attach
the end to a ring which the sisters could not see.</p>

<p>He emerged from beneath the bulging side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
vessel swinging his arms and blowing a mighty volume
of steam, which turned to snow as it left him.
As he made directly for the entrance again, Ph&oelig;be
ran to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Poor man, he'll be perished!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>As Droop entered the room, bringing with him a
bitter atmosphere, Ph&oelig;be appeared with a large cup
of hot tea.</p>

<p>"Here, Mr. Droop," she said, "drink this quick!"</p>

<p>Copernicus pulled off his cap and sat down to drink
his tea without a word. When he had finished it, he
pulled back his chair with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Whillikins! But 'twas cold!" he exclaimed.
"Seems mos' like heaven to get into a nice warm
room like this!"</p>

<p>"An' did ye get every thin' done right?" Rebecca
asked.</p>

<p>"I guess I did," he said, emphatically. "I don't
want to take no two bites out o' that kind o' cherry."</p>

<p>He rose and proceeded to remove his fur coverings.</p>

<p>"Goin' to start right now?" said Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>"Might's well, I guess."</p>

<p>He proceeded to the engine-room, followed by
Ph&oelig;be, who watched his actions with the greatest
interest.</p>

<p>"What you doin' with that handle?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That sets the airyplane on the uptilt. I'm only
settin' it a mite&mdash;jest 'nough to keep the machine
from sinkin' down when we get to movin'."</p>

<p>"How are you goin' to lift us up?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just let out a mite o' gas below," said Droop.
He suited the action to the word, and, with a tremendous
hissing beneath it, the vessel rose slowly.</p>

<p>Droop pulled the starting lever and they moved
forward with increasing speed. When they had gathered
way, he shut off the gas escape and carefully
readjusted the aeroplanes until the machine as a
whole moved horizontally.</p>

<p>There was felt a slight jerk as they reached the
end of the rope, and then they began to move in a
circle from east to west.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be glanced at the clock.</p>

<p>"Just five minutes past eight," she said.</p>

<p>The sun was pouring its beams into the right-hand
windows when they started, but the shafts of light
now began to sweep circularly across the floor, and
in a few moments, as they faced the sun, it ceased
to shine in from the right. Immediately afterward
it shone in at the left-hand windows and circled slowly
around until again they were in shadow with the
sun behind them.</p>

<p>Droop took out his watch and timed their revolutions
by the sun's progress from window to window.</p>

<p>"'Bout one to the minute," he remarked. "Guess
I'll speed her up a mite."</p>

<p>Carefully he regulated the speed, timing their
revolutions accurately.</p>

<p>"There!" he said at length. "I guess that's pretty
nigh two to the minute. D'ye feel any side weight?"
he said, addressing his companions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Rebecca.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be shook her head.</p>

<p>"You manage right well, Mr. Droop," she said.
"You must have practised a good deal."</p>

<p>"Oh, not much," he replied, greatly pleased. "The
future man showed me how to work it three&mdash;four
times. It's simple 'nough when ye understand the
principles."</p>

<p>These remarks brought a new idea to Rebecca's
mind.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Droop," she exclaimed, "whatever's the
use o' you goin' back to 1876! Why don't ye jest
set up as the inventor o' this machine? I'm sure
thet ought to make yer everlastin' fortune!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought o' that," he said. "But it's one
thing to know how to work a thing an' it's a sight
different to know how it's made an' all that. The
future man tried to explain all the new scientific
principles that was mixed into it&mdash;fer makin' power
an' all&mdash;but I couldn't understand that part at
all."</p>

<p>"An' besides," exclaimed Ph&oelig;be, "it's a heap more
fun to be the only ones can use the thing, I think."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;seems like fun's all we're thinkin' of," said
Rebecca, rising and moving toward the kitchen.
"We're jest settin' round doin' nothin'. I'll finish
with the breakfast things if you'll put to rights and
dust, Ph&oelig;be. We can't make beds till night with
the windows tight shut."</p>

<p>These suggestions were followed by the two wom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>en,
while Droop, picking up the newspaper which
Rebecca had brought, sat down to read.</p>

<p>After a long term of quiet reading, his attention
was distracted by Rebecca's voice.</p>

<p>"I declare to goodness, Ph&oelig;be!" she was saying.
"Seems's if every chance you get, you go to readin'
those old letters."</p>

<p>"Well, the's one or two that's spelled so funny and
written so badly that I haven't been able yet to read
them," Ph&oelig;be replied.</p>

<p>Droop looked over his paper. Ph&oelig;be and her sister
were seated near one of the windows on the opposite
side.</p>

<p>"P'raps I could help ye, Cousin Ph&oelig;be," he said.
"I've got mighty strong eyesight."</p>

<p>"Oh, 'tain't a question of eyesight," Ph&oelig;be replied,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said Droop, smiling slyly, "letters
from some young feller, eh?"</p>

<p>He winked knowingly at Rebecca, who drew herself
up indignantly and looked severely down at her
knitting.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be blushed, but replied quite calmly:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;some of them from a young man, but they
weren't any of them written to me."</p>

<p>"No?" said Droop. "Who was they to&mdash;'f I may
ask?"</p>

<p>"They were all written to this lady."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be held something out for Droop's inspection,
and he walked over to take it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>He recognized at once the miniature on ivory
which he had seen once before in Peltonville.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, taking the portrait from her and
eying it with his head on one side, "if ye hadn't said
'twasn't you, I'd certainly a-thought 'twas. I'd mos'
sworn 'twas your photygraph, Cousin Ph&oelig;be. Who
is it, anyway?"</p>

<p>"It isn't anybody," she replied, "but it <i>was</i> Mistress
Mary Burton of Burton Hall. I'm one of her
descendants, an' these are some letters she had with
her in this funny old carved box when she disappeared
with her lover. They fled to Holland and
were married there, the story goes, an' one o' their
children came over in the early days o' New England.
He brought the letters an' the picture with him."</p>

<p>"Well, now! I want to know!" exclaimed Droop,
in great admiration. "'Twouldn't be perlite, I
s'pose, to ask to hear some o' them letters?"</p>

<p>"Would you like to hear some of them?" Ph&oelig;be
asked.</p>

<p>"I would fer a fact," he replied.</p>

<p>"Well, bring your chair over here and I'll read
you one," she said.</p>

<p>Droop seated himself near the two sisters and
Ph&oelig;be unfolded a large and rather rough sheet of
paper, yellow with age, on which Droop perceived
a bold scrawl in a faded ink.</p>

<p>"This seems to have been from Mary Burton's
father," Ph&oelig;be said. "I don't think he can have
been a very nice man. This is what he says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Dear Poll'&mdash;horrid nickname, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Seems so to me," said Droop.</p>

<p>"'Dear Poll&mdash;I'm starting behind the grays for
London, on my way, as you know ere this, to be
knighted by her Majesty. I send this ahead by Gregory
on Bess&mdash;she being fast enow for my purpose&mdash;which
is to get thee straight out of the grip of
that'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be hesitated.</p>

<p>"He uses a bad word there," she said, in a low
tone. "I'll go on and leave that out."</p>

<p>"Yes, do," said Droop.</p>

<p>"'That &mdash;&mdash; aunt of thine,'" she continued, reading.
"'I know her tricks and I learn how she hath
suffered that'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's another," said Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>"Skip it," said Droop, gravely.</p>

<p>"'That &mdash;&mdash; milk-and-water popinjay to come
courting my Poll. So see you follow Gregory, mistress,
and without wait or parley come with him to
the Peacock Inn, where I lie to-night. The grays
are in fine fettle and thy black mare grows too fat
for want of exercise. Thy mother-in-law commands
thy instant return with Gregory, having much business
forward with preparing gowns and fallals against
our presentation to her Majesty.'"</p>

<p>"It is signed 'Isaac Burton,'" said Ph&oelig;be, "and
see, the paper was sealed with a steel gauntlet."</p>

<p>Droop examined the seal carefully and then returned
it, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Looks to me like a bunch of 'sparagus tumbled
over on one side."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be laughed.</p>

<p>"But what always interests me most in this letter
is the postscript," she said. "It reads: 'Thy mother
thinks thou wilt make better speed if I make thee
to know that the players thou wottest of'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's a 'wottest'?" said Droop, in puzzled
tones.</p>

<p>"Wottest means knowest&mdash;haven't you read
Shakespeare?"</p>

<p>"No," said Droop.</p>

<p>"'The players thou wottest of are to stop at the
Peacock, and will be giving some sport there.'</p>

<p>"Now, those players always interest me," Ph&oelig;be
continued. "Somehow I can't help but believe that
William Shakespeare&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fiddle ends!" Rebecca interrupted. "I've heard
that talk fifty-leven times an' I'm pinin' fer relief.
Mr. Droop, would you mind tellin' us what the time
o' year is now. Seems to me that sun has whirled
in an' out o' that window 'nough times to bring us
back to the days o' creation."</p>

<p>Droop consulted the date indicator and announced
that it was now September 5, 1897.</p>

<p>"Not a year yet!" cried the two women together.</p>

<p>"Why, no," said Copernicus. "Ye see, we are
takin' about three hours to lose a year."</p>

<p>"Fer the lands sakes!" cried Rebecca. "Can't we
go a little faster?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"My gracious, yes!" said Droop. "But I'm 'fraid
o' the side weight fer ye."</p>

<p>"I'd rather hev side weight than wait forever,"
said Rebecca, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>"D'ye think ye could stand a little more speed,
Cousin Ph&oelig;be?" said Droop.</p>

<p>"We might try," she replied.</p>

<p>"Well, let's try, then," he said, and turned promptly
to the engine-room.</p>

<p>Very soon the difference in speed was felt, and
as they found themselves travelling more rapidly in
a circle, the centrifugal force now became distinctly
perceptible.</p>

<p>The two women found themselves obliged to lean
somewhat toward the central pole to counteract this
tendency, and as Copernicus emerged from the engine-room
he came toward the others at a decided
angle to the floor.</p>

<p>"There! now ye feel the side weight," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"My, ain't it funny!" exclaimed Rebecca. "Thet's
the way I've felt afore now when the cars was goin'
round a curve&mdash;kinder topplin' like."</p>

<p>"Why, that is the centrifugal force," Ph&oelig;be said,
with dignity.</p>

<p>"It's the side weight&mdash;that's what I call it," Droop
replied, obstinately, and for some time there was
silence.</p>

<p>"How many years back are we makin' by the hour
now, Mr. Droop?" Rebecca asked at length.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jest a little over two hours fer a year now," he
replied.</p>

<p>"Well," said Rebecca, in a discontented tone, "I
think the old Panchronicle is rayther a slow actin'
concern, considerin' th' amount o' side weight it
makes. I declare I'm mos' tired out leanin' over to
one side, like old man Titus's paralytic cow."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be laughed and Droop replied:</p>

<p>"If ye can't stand it or set it, why lay, Cousin
Rebecca. The's good settles all 'round."</p>

<p>With manifestly injured feelings Droop hunted
up a book and sat down to read in silence. The
Panchronicon was his pet and he did not relish its
being thus contemned.</p>

<p>The remainder of the morning was spent in almost
completely silent work or reading. Droop scarce
took his eyes from his book. Ph&oelig;be spent part of
the time deep in the Baconian work and part of the
time contemplating the monotonous landscape. Rebecca
was dreaming of her future past&mdash;or her past
future, while her knitting grew steadily upon its
needles.</p>

<p>The midday meal was duly prepared and disposed
of, and, as the afternoon wore away, the three travellers
began to examine the date indicator and to ask
themselves surreptitiously whether or not they actually
felt any younger. They took sly peeps at each
other's faces to observe, if possible, any signs of returning
youth.</p>

<p>By supper-time there was certainly a less aged air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
about each of the three and the elders inwardly congratulated
themselves upon the unmistakable effects
of another twelve hours.</p>

<p>Not long after the supper dishes had been washed,
Rebecca took Ph&oelig;be aside and said:</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be, it seems to me you'd ought to be goin'
to bed right soon, now. You're only 'bout eighteen
years old at present, an' you'll certainly begin to
grow smaller again very soon. It wouldn't hardly
be respectable fer ye to do yer shrinkin' out here."</p>

<p>This view of the probabilities had not yet struck
Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>"Why, no!" she exclaimed, rather startled. "I&mdash;I
don't know's I thought about it. But I certainly
don't want Mr. Droop to see me when my clothes
begin to hang loose."</p>

<p>Then a new problem presented itself.</p>

<p>"Come to think of it, Rebecca," she said, dolefully,
"what'll I do all the time between full-grown and
baby size? I didn't bring anything but the littlest
clothes, you know."</p>

<p>"Thet's so," said Rebecca, thoughtfully. Then,
after a pause: "I don't see but ye'll hev to stay abed,
Ph&oelig;be, till we get to th' end," she said, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"There it is," said Ph&oelig;be, crossly. "Gettin' sent
to bed a'ready&mdash;even before I expected it."</p>

<p>"But 'tain't that, Ph&oelig;be," said Rebecca, with great
concern. "I ain't sendin' ye to bed&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;whatever
else <i>can</i> ye do with a <i>man</i> in the house!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothin'," Ph&oelig;be replied, with a toss of her chin.</p>

<p>She crossed the room and held out her hand to
Droop.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Mr. Droop," she said.</p>

<p>Surprised at this sudden demonstration of friendship,
he took her hand and tipped his head to one
side as he looked into her face.</p>

<p>"Next time you see me, I don't suppose you'll know
me, I'll be so little," she said, trying to laugh.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wish't you'd call me Cousin Copernicus,"
he said, coaxingly.</p>

<p>"Well, p'raps I will when I see ye again," she replied,
freeing her hand with a slight effort.</p>

<p>Rebecca retired shortly after her sister and Copernicus
was once more left alone. He rubbed his hands
slowly, with a sense of satisfaction, and glanced at
the date dial.</p>

<p>"July 2, 1892," he said to himself. "I'm only thirty-four
years old. Don't feel any older than that,
either."</p>

<p>He walked deliberately to the shutters, closed
them and turned on the electric light. Surrounded
thus by the wonted conditions of night, it was not
long before he began to yawn. He removed his coat
and shoes and lay back in an easy chair to meditate
at ease. He faced toward the pole so that the "side
weight" would tend to press him gently backward
into his chair and therefore not annoy him by calling
for constant opposing effort.</p>

<p>He soon dozed off and was whisked through a quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
succession of fantastic dreams. Then he awoke suddenly,
and as though someone had spoken to him.
Listening intently, he only heard the low murmur
of the machinery below and the ticking of the many
clocks and indicators all about him.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, intending to take up that last
dream where he had been interrupted. He recollected
that he had been on the very point of some
delightful consummation, but just what it was he
could not recall.</p>

<p>Sleep evaded him, however. His mind reverted
to the all-important question of the recovered years.
He began to plan again.</p>

<p>This time he should not make his former mistakes.
No&mdash;he would not only make immense wealth
promptly with the great inventions, he would give
up liquor forever. It would be so easy in 1876, for
he had never taken up the unfortunate habit until
1888.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;rich, young, sober, he would seek out a
charming, rosy, good-natured girl&mdash;something of the
type of Ph&oelig;be, for instance. They would be married
and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He got up at this and looked at the clock. It was
after midnight. He looked at the date indicator.
It said October 9, 1890.</p>

<p>"Well, come!" he thought. "The old Panchronicon
is a steady vessel. She's keepin' right on."</p>

<p>He put on his shoes again, for something made him
nervous and he wished to walk up and down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The first thing he did after his shoes were donned
was to gaze at himself in the mirror.</p>

<p>"Don't look any younger," he thought, "but I feel
so." He walked across the room once or twice.</p>

<p>"Shucks!" he exclaimed. "Couldn't expect to look
younger in these old duds, an' at this time o' night,
too&mdash;tired like I am."</p>

<p>For some time he walked up and down, keeping
his eyes resolutely from the date indicator. Finally
he threw himself down in the chair again and closed
his eyes, nervous and exhausted. He did not feel
sleepy, but he must have dozed, for the next time
he looked at the clock it was half-past one.</p>

<p>He put out the light and crossed to a settle. Here
he lay at full length courting sleep. When he awoke,
he thought, refreshed and alert, he would show his
youth unmistakably.</p>

<p>But sleep would not return. He tried every position,
every trick for propitiating Morpheus. All in
vain.</p>

<p>At length he rose again and turned on the light.
It was two-fifteen. This time he could not resist
looking at the date indicator.</p>

<p>It said September 30, 1889.</p>

<p>Again he looked into the glass.</p>

<p>"My, but I'm nervous!" he thought as he turned
away, disappointed. "I look older than ever!"</p>

<p>As he paced the floor there all alone, he began to
doubt for the first time the success of his plan.</p>

<p>"It <i>must</i> work right!" he said aloud. "Didn't I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
go back five weeks with that future man? Didn't
he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A fearful thought struck him. Had he perhaps
made a mistake? Had they been cutting meridians
the wrong way?</p>

<p>But no; the indicator could not be wrong, and that
registered a constantly earlier date.</p>

<p>"Ah, I know!" he suddenly exclaimed. "I'll ask
Cousin Ph&oelig;be."</p>

<p>He reflected a moment. Yes&mdash;the idea was a good
one. She would be only fifteen years old by this
time, and must certainly have changed to an extent
of which he was at his age incapable. Besides, she
had been asleep, and nervous insomnia could not be
responsible for retarding the evidences of youth in
her case. His agony of dread lest this great experiment
fail made him bold.</p>

<p>He walked directly to Ph&oelig;be's door and knocked&mdash;first
softly, then more loudly.</p>

<p>"Cousin Ph&oelig;be&mdash;Cousin Ph&oelig;be," he said.</p>

<p>After a few calls and knockings, there came a
sleepy reply from within.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what&mdash;who is it?"</p>

<p>"It's Cousin Copernicus," he said. "Please tell
me. Hev ye shrunk any yet?"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;how?" The tones were very sleepy indeed.</p>

<p>"Hev ye shrunk any yet? Are ye growin' littler
in there? Oh, please feel fer the footboard with
yer toe!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>He waited and heard a rustling as of someone
moving in bed.</p>

<p>"Did ye feel the footboard?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;kicked it good&mdash;now let me sleep." She
was ill-natured with much drowsiness.</p>

<p>Poor Droop staggered away from the door as
though he had been struck.</p>

<p>All had failed, then. They were circling uselessly.
Those inventions would never be his. The golden
dreams he had been nursing&mdash;oh, impossible! It was
unbearable!</p>

<p>He put both hands to his head and walked across
the room. He paused half-consciously before a small
closet partly hidden in the wall.</p>

<p>With an instinctive movement, he touched a spring
and the door slid back. He drew from the cupboard
thus revealed two bottles and a glass and returned
to seat himself at the table.</p>

<p>A half an hour later the Panchronicon, circling
in the outer brightness and silence, contained three
unconscious travellers, and one of them sat with his
arms flung across the table supporting his head, and
beside him an empty bottle.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">SHIPWRECKED ON THE SANDS OF TIME</h3>


<p>Rebecca was the first of the three to waken. Over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
her small window she had hung a black shawl to keep
out the light, and upon this screen were thrown recurrent
flashes of sunlight.</p>

<p>"Still a-swingin'," she murmured. "Wonder how
fur back we be now!"</p>

<p>She was herself surprised at the eagerness she felt
to observe at last the results of their extraordinary
attempt.</p>

<p>She rose quickly and was very soon ready to leave
her room. She was longing to see Ph&oelig;be&mdash;Ph&oelig;be
as she had been when a girl.</p>

<p>Opening her door, she was astonished to find the
lamps of the main room aglow and to see Copernicus
in his shirt-sleeves, asleep with his head on the table.</p>

<p>As she stepped out of her own room, her senses
were offended by the odor of alcohol. With horror
she realized that rum, the spirit of all the sources of
evil, had found its way into their abode.</p>

<p>She entertained so violent a repugnance for liquors
and for men under their influence that she could not
bring herself to approach Copernicus.</p>

<p>"He's gone an' got drunk again," she muttered,
glaring with helpless anger at the bottles and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
at him.</p>

<p>"Mister Droop! Copernicus Droop!" she cried in
a high, sharp voice.</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>She looked about her for something to prod him
with. There was an arm-chair on casters beside her
door. She drew this to her and pushed it with all
her might toward the unconscious man.</p>

<p>The chair struck violently against Droop's seat,
and even caused his body to sway slightly, but he
still slept and gave no sign.</p>

<p>"That settles it!" she exclaimed, with mingled disgust
and alarm in her face.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>It was Ph&oelig;be who called.</p>

<p>"It's me," said Rebecca. "Can I come in?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Rebecca walked into Ph&oelig;be's room, which she
found darkened like her own. Her sister was in bed.</p>

<p>"What ever happened to you?" Ph&oelig;be asked.
"Sounded as though ye'd fallen down or somethin'."</p>

<p>Rebecca stood stiffly with her back to the closed
door, her hands folded before her.</p>

<p>"Copernicus Droop is tight! Dead drunk!" she
exclaimed, with a shaking voice.</p>

<p>"Drunk!" cried Ph&oelig;be. "Lands sakes!&mdash;an'&mdash;"
She looked about her with alarm. "Then what's happened
to the machine?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Whirlin', whirlin', same as ever! Cuttin' merid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>ians
or sausage meat fer all I care. I jest wish to
goodness an' all creation I'd never ben sech a plumb
born nateral fool as to&mdash;oh, wouldn't I like to jest
<i>shake</i> that man!" she broke out, letting her anger
gain the upper hand.</p>

<p>Then Ph&oelig;be recalled their situation and their expectations
of the night before.</p>

<p>"Why, then I ought to be gettin' little pretty fast,"
she said, feeling her arms. "I don't see's I've shrunk
a mite, hev I?"</p>

<p>"No more'n I hev!" Rebecca exclaimed, hotly.
"Nor you won't, nuther. Ye might jest's well make
up yer mind to it thet the whole business is foolish
folderols. We're a nice couple o' geese, we are, to
come out here to play 'Here we go round the mulberry
bush' with the North Pole&mdash;an' all along of
a shif'less, notorious slave o' rum!"</p>

<p>She plumped herself into a chair and glared at
the darkened window as though fascinated by those
ever-returning flashes of sunlight.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;well!" murmured Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>She was much disappointed, and yet somehow she
could not avoid a certain pleasure in the thought
that at least there was no fear of a return to childhood.</p>

<p>"But what're we goin' to do?" she asked at length.
"If Mr. Droop's so tight he can't manage the machine,
what'll we do. Here we are tied up to the
North Pole&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, drat the old Panchronicon!" cried Rebecca.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Then rising in her wrath, she continued with energy:
"The's one thing I'm goin' to do right this blessed
minute. I'm goin' to draw a hull bucket o' cold
water an' throw it over that mis'able critter in there!
Think o' him sleepin' on the table&mdash;the table as we
eat our victuals on!"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no. Don't try to wake him up first!" cried
Ph&oelig;be. "Let's have breakfast&mdash;we can have it in
the kitchen&mdash;an' then you can douse him afterward.
Just think of the wipin' an' cleanin' we'll have to do
after it. We'll be starved if we wait breakfast for
all that ruction!"</p>

<p>Rebecca reflected a moment. Then:</p>

<p>"I guess ye're right, Ph&oelig;be," she said. "My, won't
that carpet look a sight! I'll go right an' fix up somethin'
to eat, though goodness knows, I'm not hungry."</p>

<p>She left Ph&oelig;be to dress and made a wide circuit
to avoid even approaching the table on her way to
the kitchen. Not long afterward she was followed
by her sister, who took a similar roundabout path,
for Ph&oelig;be was quite as much in horror of drink and
drinkers as Rebecca.</p>

<p>She glanced at the date indicator as she passed it.</p>

<p>"My sakes!" she said, as she entered the kitchen,
"it's March 25, 1887. Why, then's the time that I
had the measles so bad. Don't you remember when
I was thirteen years old an' Dr. &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rebecca broke in with a snort.</p>

<p>"Eighty-seven grandmothers!" she exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
"Don't you get to frettin' 'bout gettin' the measles
or anything else, Ph&oelig;be&mdash;only sof'nin' of the brain&mdash;I
guess we've both got that right bad!"</p>

<p>"I don't know 'bout that," Ph&oelig;be replied, as she
began to set the small table for two. "I believe we're
gettin' back, after all, Rebecca. The's one thing sure.
Everybody knows that ye lose a day every time you
go round the world once from east to west, an' I'm
sure we've gone round often enough to lose years.
I believe that indicator's all right."</p>

<p>"We've not ben goin' round the world, though,"
Rebecca replied. "That's the p'int. This old iron
clothes-pole out here ain't the hull world, I can tell
ye!"</p>

<p>"Well, but all the meridians&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, bother yer meridians! I ain't seen one o'
the things yet&mdash;nor you hevn't, either, Ph&oelig;be
Wise!"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was not convinced. It seemed not at all
unreasonable, after all, that they should lose time
without undergoing any physical change. She concluded
to argue the matter no further, however.</p>

<p>Their meal was eaten in silence. As they rose to
clear the table, Ph&oelig;be said:</p>

<p>"Th' ain't any use of goin' back to 1876 now, is
there, Rebecca. Though I do s'pose it won't make
any difference to Mr. Droop. He can bring out his
inventions an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not with my money, or Joe Chandler's, either,"
Rebecca declared, firmly. "Not as Joe'd ask me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
marry him now. He'd as soon think o' marryin' his
grandmother."</p>

<p>"Then what's the use o' goin' back any further.
We might's well stop the machine right now, so's
not to have so many more turns to wind up again."</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks!" Rebecca exclaimed. "Don't you
fret about that! Don't I tell ye it's folderol!
Tell ye what ye can do, though. Open them shutters
out there an' let in some sunlight. I've more'n
half a mind to open a window, too. Thet smell o'
rum in there makes me sick."</p>

<p>"We'd freeze to death in a minute if we tried it,"
said Ph&oelig;be, as she entered the main room.</p>

<p>She went to each of the four windows and opened
all the shutters, avoiding in the meantime even a
glance at the middle of the room. She did not forget
the date indicator, however.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas!" she cried, with a little laugh.
"It's Christmas-day, 1886, Rebecca."</p>

<p>The engine-room door was open. Perhaps it was
a sign of her returning youth, but the fact is her
fingers itched to get at those bright, tempting brass
and steel handles. Droop had explained their uses
and she felt sure she could manage the machinery.
What a delightful thing it would be to feel the Panchronicon
obeying her hand!</p>

<p>"Really, Rebecca," she exclaimed, "if we're not
going back to '76 after all, I think it's a dreadful
waste of time for us to be throwin' away six months
every hour this way."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Twon't be long," Rebecca replied, as she turned
the hot water into her dishpan. "You come in here
an' help wash these dishes, an' ef I don't soon wake
up that mis'able&mdash;" She did not trust herself further,
but tightly compressed her lips and confined
her rising choler.</p>

<p>"Why, Rebecca Wise," said Ph&oelig;be, "you know
it will be hours before that man's got sense enough
to run this machine. I'm goin' to stop it myself,
right now."</p>

<p>Rebecca had just taken a hot plate from her pan,
but she paused ere setting it down, alarmed at Ph&oelig;be's
temerity.</p>

<p>"Don't you dast to dream o' sech a thing, Ph&oelig;be!"
she cried, with frightened earnestness.</p>

<p>But Ph&oelig;be was confident, and crossed the threshold
with a little laugh.</p>

<p>"Why, Rebecca, what you scared of?" she said.
"It's just as easy as that&mdash;see!"</p>

<p>She pulled the starting lever.</p>

<p>The next instant found her flying out into the
middle of the main room following Droop, the table,
and all the movable furniture. In the kitchen there
was a wild scream and a crash of crockery as Rebecca
was thrown against the rear partition.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be had pulled the lever the wrong way and
the Panchronicon was swiftly reaching full speed.</p>

<p>"Heavens and airth!" cried Rebecca.</p>

<p>"Whatever in gracious&mdash;" began the dismayed
Ph&oelig;be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>She broke off in renewed terror as she found herself
pushed by an irresistible force to the side of the
room.</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;here!" she heard from the kitchen.
"What's this a-pullin'? Land o' promise, Ph&oelig;be,
come quick! I've got a stroke!"</p>

<p>"I can't come!" wailed Ph&oelig;be. "I'm jammed tight
up against the wall. It's as though I was nailed
to it."</p>

<p>"Oh, why&mdash;why did ye touch that machinery!"
cried Rebecca, and then said no more.</p>

<p>The speed indicator pointed to one hundred and
seventy-five miles an hour. They were making one
revolution around the pole each second&mdash;and they
were helpless.</p>

<p>As she found herself pushed outward by the immensely
increased centrifugal force, Ph&oelig;be found it
possible to seat herself upon one of the settles, and
she now sat with her back pressed firmly against the
south wall of the room, only able by a strong effort
to raise her head.</p>

<p>She turned to the right and found that Droop had
found a couch on the floor under the table and chairs
at the rear of the room, also against the south wall.</p>

<p>In the kitchen Rebecca had crouched down as she
found herself forced outward, and she now sat dazed
on the kitchen floor surrounded by the fragments
of their breakfast all glued to the wall as tightly
as herself.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear&mdash;oh, dear!" she cried, closing her eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
"Copernicus Droop said that side weight would be
terrible if we travelled too fast. Why, I'm so heavy
sideways I feel like as if I weighed 497&frac12; pounds like
that fat woman in the circus down to Keene."</p>

<p>"So do I," Ph&oelig;be said, "only I'm so dizzy, too, I
can hardly think."</p>

<p>"Shet your eyes, like me," said Rebecca.</p>

<p>"I would only I can't keep 'em off the North Pole
there," said Ph&oelig;be, as she gazed fascinated through
the north window opposite.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter with the child!" Rebecca
exclaimed, in alarm. "Air ye struck silly, Ph&oelig;be?"</p>

<p>"No, but I guess you'd want to watch it too if you
could see that ring we're tied to spinnin' round right
close to the top of the pole. There&mdash;there!" she continued,
shrilly. "It'll fly right off in another minute!
There! Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>Their attachment did indeed appear precarious.
The increased speed acting through the inclined aeroplane
had caused the vessel to rise sharply, and the
rope had raised the ring by which it was attached
to the pole until it came in contact with the steel
ball at the top, when it could rise no farther. Here
the iron ring was grinding against and under the
retaining ball which alone prevented its slipping off
the top of the pole.</p>

<p>"I don't see's we'd be any wuss off ef we did come
loose," said Rebecca, with eyes still closed. "At least
we wouldn't be gummed here ez tight's if the walls
was fly-paper."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, but we'd fly off at a tangent into infinite
space, Rebecca Wise," Ph&oelig;be said, sharply.</p>

<p>"Where's that?" asked her sister. "I'll engage
'tain't any wuss place than the North Pole."</p>

<p>"Why, it's off into the ether. There isn't any
air there or anythin'. An' they say it's fifty times
colder than the North Pole."</p>

<p>"Who's ben there?"</p>

<p>"Why, nobody&mdash;" Ph&oelig;be began.</p>

<p>"Then let's drop it," snapped Rebecca. "Dr. Kane
said the' was an open sea at the North Pole&mdash;an'
I'm sick o' bein' told about places nobody's ever ben
to before."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was somewhat offended at this and there
was a long silence, during which she became more
reassured touching the danger of breaking away
from the Pole. Soon she, too, was able to shut
her eyes.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by a meek voice from under
the table.</p>

<p>"Would you mind settin' off my chist?" said Droop.</p>

<p>There was no answer and he opened his eyes. His
bewilderment and surprise were intense when he discovered
his situation.</p>

<p>Shutting his eyes again, he remarked:</p>

<p>"What you flashin' that bright light in my eyes
so often for?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be gave vent to a gentle sniff of contempt.</p>

<p>"My&mdash;my&mdash;my!" Droop continued, in meek
amazement. "I s'pose I must hev taken two whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
bottles. I never, never felt so heavy's this before!
What's the old Pan lyin' on it's side fer?"</p>

<p>"'Tain't on its side," snapped Ph&oelig;be. "The old
thing's run away, Copernicus Droop, an' it's all your
fault." There was a quiver in her voice.</p>

<p>"Run away!" said Droop, opening his eyes again.
"Where to?"</p>

<p>"Nowheres&mdash;jest whirlin'. Only it's goin' a mile
a second, I do believe&mdash;an' it'll fly off the pole soon&mdash;an'&mdash;an'
we'll all be killed!" she cried, bursting
into tears.</p>

<p>She dragged her hands with great difficulty to her
face against which she found them pressed with considerable
energy. Crying under these circumstances
was so very unusual and uncomfortable that she soon
gave it up.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see! It's the side weight holds me here.
Where are you?"</p>

<p>There was no reply, so he turned his head and
eyes this way and that until at length he spied Ph&oelig;be
on the settle, farther forward.</p>

<p>"Am I under the table?" he said. "Where's Cousin
Rebecca? Was she pressed out through the wall?"</p>

<p>"I'm out here in the kitchen, Copernicus Droop,"
she cried. "I wish to goodness you'd ben pressed in
through the walls of the lock-up 'fore ever ye brought
me'n Ph&oelig;be into this mess. Ef you're a man or
half one, you'll go and stop this pesky old Panchronicle
an' give us a chance to move."</p>

<p>"How can I go?" he cried, peevishly. "What the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
lands sakes did you go an' make the machine run
away for? Couldn't ye leave the machinery alone?"</p>

<p>"I didn't touch your old machine!" cried Rebecca.
"Ph&oelig;be thought we'd be twisted back of our first
birthday ef the thing wasn't stopped, an' she pulled
the handle the wrong way, that's all!"</p>

<p>Droop rolled his eyes about eagerly for a glimpse
of the date indicator.</p>

<p>"What's the date, Cousin Ph&oelig;be?" he asked.</p>

<p>"April 4, 1884&mdash;no, April 3d&mdash;2d&mdash;oh, dear, it's
goin' back so fast I can't tell ye the truth about it!"</p>

<p>"Early in 1884," Droop repeated, in awe-struck
accents. "An' we're a-whirlin' off one day every
second&mdash;just about one year in six minutes. Great
Criminy crickets! When was you born, Cousin
Ph&oelig;be?"</p>

<p>"Second of April, 1874."</p>

<p>"Ten years. One year in six minutes&mdash;gives ye
jest one hour to live. Then you'll go out&mdash;bang!&mdash;like
a candle. I'll go next, and Cousin Rebecca
last."</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed Rebecca, angrily, "ef I can hev
the pleasure o' bein' rid o' you, Copernicus Droop,
it'll be cheap at the price&mdash;but the's no sech luck.
Ef you think ye can fool us any more with yer twaddle
'bout cuttin' meridians, ye're mistaken&mdash;that's
all I can say."</p>

<p>Droop was making desperate efforts to climb along
the floor and reach the engine-room, but, although
by dint of gigantic struggles he managed to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
his way a few feet, he was then obliged to pause for
breath, whereupon he slid gently and ignominiously
back to his nook under the table.</p>

<p>Here he found himself in contact with a corked
bottle. He looked at it and felt comforted. At least
he had access to forgetfulness whenever he pleased
to seek it.</p>

<p>The two women found it wisest to lie quiet and
speak but little. The combined rotary movement
and sense of weight were nervously disturbing, and
for a long time no one of the three spoke. Only once
in the middle of the forenoon did Ph&oelig;be address
Droop.</p>

<p>"Whatever will be the end o' this?" she said.</p>

<p>"Why, we'll keep on whirlin' till the power gives
out," he replied. "Ye hevn't much time to live now,
hev ye?"</p>

<p>With a throb of fear felt for the first time, Ph&oelig;be
looked at the indicator.</p>

<p>"It's May, 1874," she said.</p>

<p>"Jest a month&mdash;thirty seconds," he said, sadly.</p>

<p>"Copernicus Droop, do you mean it?" screamed
Rebecca from the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Unless the power gives out before then," he replied.
"I don't suppose ye want to make yer will,
do ye?"</p>

<p>"Stuff!" said Ph&oelig;be, bravely, but her gaze was
fixed anxiously on the indicator, now fast approaching
the 2d of April.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! 'F I could only see ye, Ph&oelig;be!" cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Rebecca. "I know he's a mis'able deceivin' man, but
if&mdash;if&mdash;oh, Ph&oelig;be, can't ye holler!"</p>

<p>"It's April 8th&mdash;good-bye!" Ph&oelig;be said, faintly.</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be&mdash;Ph&oelig;be!"</p>

<p>"Hurray&mdash;hurray! It's March 31st, and here I
am!"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be tried to clap her hands, but the effort was
in vain.</p>

<p>"I allus said it was folderol," said Rebecca, sternly.
"Oh, but I'd like to throw somethin' at that Copernicus
Droop!"</p>

<p>"Come to think of it," said Droop, "that future
man must hev come back long, long before his birthday."</p>

<p>"Why didn't ye say that sooner?" cried Rebecca.</p>

<p>There was no further conversation until long afterward,
when Rebecca suddenly remarked:</p>

<p>"Aren't ye hungry, Ph&oelig;be?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's gettin' along to dinner-time, ain't it?"
she replied. "I don't see, though, how I'm to get
any victuals, do you?"</p>

<p>"Why, the's bread an' other scraps slammed up
against the wall here all round me," said Rebecca.
"Couldn't we fix some way to get some of 'em to ye?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be looked anxiously about and finally caught
sight of her sister's knitting work near at hand. It
proved to be just within reach, and by slow degrees
and much effort she brought it into her lap within
easy reach of both her heavy hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she said, "I feel's if both my arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
had turned to lead. Here, Rebecca, I'm goin' to see
if I can roll your ball o' yarn along the floor through
the kitchen door. The centrifugal force will bring
it to you. Then you can cut the yarn an' tie somethin'
on the end for me to eat an' I'll haul it back
through the door."</p>

<p>"That's jest the thing, Ph&oelig;be. Go on&mdash;I'm
ready."</p>

<p>The theory seemed excellent, as Rebecca had fortunately
been working with a very tough flaxen yarn;
but so great was the apparent weight of Ph&oelig;be's
arms that it was only after a long series of trials ending
in failures that she finally succeeded.</p>

<p>"I've got it!" cried Rebecca, triumphantly. "Now,
then, I've got a slice of ham and two slices of
bread&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't send ham," said Ph&oelig;be. "I'd be sure to
eat it if I had it, an' 'twould make me fearful dry.
I'm sure I don't see how I'm to get any water in
here."</p>

<p>"Thet's so," said Rebecca. "Well, here's an apple
and two slices of bread."</p>

<p>"Are you keepin' enough for yourself, Rebecca?"</p>

<p>"Enough an' to spare," she replied. "Now, then&mdash;all
ready! Pull 'em along!"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be obeyed and soon had secured possession of
the frugal meal which Rebecca had been able to convey
to her.</p>

<p>She offered a portion of her ration to Droop, but
he declined it, saying he had no appetite. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
lapsed into a kind of waking reverie and scarce knew
what was going on about him.</p>

<p>The two women also were somewhat stupefied by
the continual rotation and their enforced immobility.
They spoke but seldom and must have dozed frequently,
for Ph&oelig;be was much surprised to find, on
looking at the clock, that it was half-past five.</p>

<p>She glanced at the date indicator.</p>

<p>"Why, Rebecca!" she cried. "Here 'tis November,
1804!"</p>

<p>"My land!" cried Rebecca, forgetting her scepticism.
"What do you s'pose they're doin' in New
Hampshire now, Ph&oelig;be?"</p>

<p>"It's 'bout election time, Rebecca. They're probably
votin' for Adams or Madison or somebody like
that."</p>

<p>"My stars!" said Rebecca. "What ever shall we
do ef this old machine goes on back of the Revolution!
I should hate to go back an' worry through
all them terrible times."</p>

<p>"We'll be lucky if we stop there," said Ph&oelig;be.
"I only hope to gracious we won't go back to Columbus
or King Alfred."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope not!" said Rebecca, with a shudder.
"Folks ud think we was crazy to be talkin' 'bout
America then."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be tried to toss her head.</p>

<p>"If 'twas in Alfred's time," she said, "they couldn't
understand <i>what</i> we was talkin' about."</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be Wise! What do you mean?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"I mean just that. There wasn't any English language
then. Besides&mdash;who's to say the old thing
won't whirl us back to the days of the Greeks an'
Romans? We could see Socrates and Pericles and
Cr&oelig;sus and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd love to see Cr&oelig;sus!" Rebecca broke in.
"He's the richest man that ever lived!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and perhaps we'll go back of then and see
Abraham and Noah."</p>

<p>"Ef we could see Noah, 'twould be worth while,"
said Rebecca. "Joe Forrest said he didn't believe
about the flood. He said Noah couldn't hev packed
all them animals in tight enough to hev got 'em all
in the Ark. I'd like mighty well if I could ask Noah
himself 'bout it."</p>

<p>"He couldn't understand ye," said Ph&oelig;be. "All
he spoke was Hebrew, ye know."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Rebecca. Then, after a pause:
"S'pose we went back to the tower of Babel. Couldn't
we find the folks that was struck with the English
language an' get one of 'em to go back an' speak to
Noah?"</p>

<p>"What good would that do? If he was struck with
English he wouldn't know Hebrew any more. That's
what made&mdash; But there!" she exclaimed, "what ninnies
we are!"</p>

<p>There was a long pause. After many minutes,
Rebecca asked one more question.</p>

<p>"Do you s'pose the flood would come up as fur's
this, Ph&oelig;be?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know, Rebecca. The Bible says the whole
earth, you know."</p>

<p>And so passed the slow hours. When they were not
dozing they were either nibbling frugally the scant
fare in reach or conversing by short snatches at long
intervals.</p>

<p>For thirty hours had they thus whirled ceaselessly
around that circle, when Ph&oelig;be, glancing through
the window at the ring to which their rope was attached,
noticed that its constant rubbing against the
ball at the top of the pole had worn it nearly through.</p>

<p>"My goodness, Rebecca!" she cried. "I believe
we're goin' off at a tangent in a minute."</p>

<p>"What? How?"</p>

<p>"The ring on the pole is nigh worn out. I believe
it'll break in a minute."</p>

<p>"If it breaks we'll move straight an' get rid o' this
side weight, won't we?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but goodness only knows where we'll fly
to."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;ain't Mr. Droop there? If the side weight
goes, he can get into the engine-room an' let us down
easy."</p>

<p>"That's so!" cried Ph&oelig;be. "Oh, won't it be grand
to stand still a minute after all this traipsin' around
and around! Mr. Droop," she continued, "do you
hear? You'd better be gettin' ready to take hold
an' stop the Panchronicon, 'cause we're goin' to break
loose in half no time."</p>

<p>There was no reply. Nor could any calling or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
pleading elicit an answer. Droop had yielded to his
thirst and was again sleeping the sleep of the unregenerate.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rebecca, what&mdash; Oh&mdash;oo&mdash;oo!"</p>

<p>There was a loud scream from both the sisters as
the iron ring, worn through by long rubbing, finally
snapped asunder.</p>

<p>The tremendous pressure was suddenly lifted, and
the two women were free.</p>

<p>With a single impulse, they flew toward the kitchen
door and fell into each other's arms.</p>

<p>The Panchronicon had gone off at a tangent at
last!</p>

<p>"Oh, Rebecca&mdash;Rebecca!" cried Ph&oelig;be, in tears.
"I was afraid I'd never see you again!"</p>

<p>Rebecca cried a little too, and patted her sister's
shoulder in silence a moment.</p>

<p>"There, deary!" she said, after awhile. "Now let's
set down an' hev a good cup o' tea. Then we can go
to bed comfortable."</p>

<p>"But, Rebecca," said Ph&oelig;be, stepping back and
wiping her eyes, "what shall we do about the Panchronicon?
We're jest makin' fer Infinite Space, or
somewheres, as fast as we can go."</p>

<p>"Can't help it, Ph&oelig;be. Ye sha'n't touch a thing
in that engine-room this day&mdash;not while I'm here.
Ye might blow us up the nex' time. No&mdash;I guess
we'll jest hev to trust in the Lord. He brought us
into this pickle, an' it's fer Him to see us out of it."</p>

<p>With this comforting reflection the two sisters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
brewed a pot of tea, and after partaking of the refreshing
decoction, went to their respective beds.</p>

<p>"I declare, I'm dog tired!" said Rebecca.</p>

<p>"So'm I," said Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>Those were their last words for many hours.</p>

<p>How long they slept after their extraordinary experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
with the runaway air-ship neither Rebecca
nor Ph&oelig;be ever knew; but when they awoke all was
still, and it was evidently dark outside, for no ray
of light found its way past the hangings they had
placed over their windows.</p>

<p>There was something uncanny in the total silence.
Even the noise of the machinery was stilled, and the
two sisters dressed together in Rebecca's room for
company's sake.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose we've arrived in Infinite Space
yet?" Rebecca asked.</p>

<p>"It's still enough fer it," Ph&oelig;be replied, in a low
voice. "But I don't hear the Panchronicon's machinery
any more. It must have run down entirely,
wherever we are."</p>

<p>At that moment there was borne faintly to their
ears the distant crowing of a cock.</p>

<p>"Well, there!" said Rebecca, with an expression
of immense relief, "I don't believe the's any hens
an' roosters in Infinite Space, is the'?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be laughed and shook her head as she ran to
the window. She drew aside the shawl hanging before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the glass and peered out.</p>

<p>The first gleams of dawn were dispelling the night,
and against a dark gray sky she saw the branches of
thickly crowding trees.</p>

<p>Dropping the shawl, she turned eagerly to her sister.</p>

<p>"Rebecca Wise!" she exclaimed. "As sure as
you're alive, we're back safe on the ground again.
We're in the woods."</p>

<p>"Mos' likely Putnam's wood lot," said Rebecca,
with great satisfaction as she finally adjusted her
cameo brooch. "Gracious! Won't I be glad to see
all the folks again!"</p>

<p>She pushed open her door and, followed by Ph&oelig;be,
entered the main room. Here all was gloom, but
they could hear Droop's breathing, and knew that he
was still sleeping under the table in the corner.</p>

<p>"For the lands sakes! Let's get out in the fresh
air," Rebecca exclaimed as she groped her way toward
the stairs. "You keep a-holt o' me, Ph&oelig;be. That's
right. We'll get out o' here an' make rabbit tracks
fer home, I tell ye. We can come back later for our
duds when that mis'able specimen is sober fer awhile
again."</p>

<p>Slowly the two made their way down the winding
stairs to the lower hall, where, after much fumbling,
they found the door handle and lock.</p>

<p>As they emerged from the prison that had so long
confined them, a cool morning zephyr swept their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
faces, bringing with it once more the well-known
voice of distant chanticleer.</p>

<p>They walked across the springing turf a few yards
and were then able to make out the looming black
mass of some building beyond the end of the air-ship.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" Rebecca whispered. "This ain't Peltonville,
Ph&oelig;be. There ain't a house in the town
as high as that, 'less it's the meetin'-house, an' 'tain't
the right shape fer that."</p>

<p>They advanced stealthily toward the newly discovered
building, in which not a single light was to
be seen.</p>

<p>"In good sooth," Ph&oelig;be exclaimed, putting one
hand on her sister's arm, "it hath an air of witchcraft!
Dost not feel cold chills in thee, Rebecca?"</p>

<p>Rebecca stopped short, stiff with amazement.</p>

<p>"What's come over ye?" she asked, trying to peer
into her sister's face. "Whatever makes ye talk like
that, child?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be laughed nervously and, taking her sister's
arm, pressed close up to her.</p>

<p>"I don't know, dear. Did I speak funny?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Why you know you did. What's the use o' tryin'
to scare a body with gibberish? This place is creepy
'nough now."</p>

<p>As she spoke, they reached the door of the strange
building. They could see that it stood open, and
even as they paused near the threshold another puff
of air passed them, and they heard a door squeak
on its rusty hinges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>They stood and listened breathlessly, peering into
the dark interior whence there was borne to their
nostrils a musty odor. A large bat whisked across
the opening, and as they started back alarmed he
returned with swift zig-zag cuts and vanished ghostlike
into the house.</p>

<p>"It's deserted," whispered Rebecca.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's haunted," Ph&oelig;be replied.</p>

<p>"Well, we needn't go in, I guess," said Rebecca,
turning from the door and starting briskly away.
"Come on this way, Ph&oelig;be&mdash;look out fer the trees&mdash;lands!
Did y'ever see so many?"</p>

<p>A few steps brought them to a high brick wall,
against which flowers, weeds, and vines grew rank
together. They followed this wall, walking more
rapidly, for the day was breaking in earnest and
groping was needless now. Presently they came to
a spot where the wall was broken away, leaving an
opening just broad enough to admit a man's body.
Rebecca squeezed boldly through and Ph&oelig;be followed
her, rather for company's sake than with any
curiosity to see what was beyond.</p>

<p>They found themselves in a sort of open common,
stretching to the edge of a broad roadway about a
hundred yards from where they stood. On the other
side of the road a cluster of gabled cottages was
visible against the faint rose tint of the eastern
sky.</p>

<p>As Ph&oelig;be came to her sister's side, she clutched
her arm excitedly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rebecca!" she exclaimed. "'Tis Newington, as
true as I live! Newington and Blackman Street!"</p>

<p>Suddenly she sat down in the grass and hid her
face in her hands.</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean?" said Rebecca, looking down
at her sister with a puzzled expression. "Where's
Newington&mdash;I never heerd tell of Blackman Street.
Air ye thinkin' of Boston, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be interrupted her by leaping to her feet and
starting back to the opening in the wall.</p>

<p>"Come back, Rebecca!" she exclaimed. "Come
back quick!"</p>

<p>Rebecca followed her sister in some alarm. Ph&oelig;be
must have been taken suddenly ill, she thought. Perhaps
they had reached one of those regions infected
by fevers of which she had heard from time to time.</p>

<p>In silence the two women hurried back to the Panchronicon,
whose uncouth form was now quite plainly
visible behind the trees into the midst of which
it had fallen when the power stored within it was
exhausted.</p>

<p>Not until they were safely seated in Rebecca's
room did Ph&oelig;be speak again.</p>

<p>"There!" she exclaimed, as she dropped to a seat
on the edge of the bed, "I declare to goodness, Rebecca,
I don't know what to make of it!"</p>

<p>"What is it? What ails ye?" said Rebecca, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Why, I don't believe I'm myself, Rebecca. I've
been here before. I know that village out there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and&mdash;and&mdash;it's all I can do to talk same's I've always
been used to. I'm wanting to talk like&mdash;like I did
awhile back."</p>

<p>"It's all right! It's all right!" said Rebecca, soothingly.
"Th' ain't nothing the matter with you,
deary. Ye've ben shet up here with side weight an'
what not so long&mdash;o' course you're not yerself."</p>

<p>She bustled about pretending to set things to
rights, but her heart was heavy with apprehension.
She thought that Ph&oelig;be was in the first stages of
delirium.</p>

<p>"Not myself! No," said Ph&oelig;be. "No&mdash;the fact
is, I'm somebody else!"</p>

<p>At this Rebecca straightened up and cast one horrified
glance at her sister. Then she turned and began
to put on her bonnet and jacket. Her mind was
made up. Ph&oelig;be was delirious and they must seek
a doctor&mdash;at once.</p>

<p>"Get your things on, Ph&oelig;be," she said, striving
to appear calm. "Put on your things an' come out
with me. Let's see if we can't take a little exercise."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be arose obediently and went to her room.
They were neither of them very long about their
preparations, and by the time the sun was actually
rising, the two women were leaving the air-ship for
the second time, Ph&oelig;be carrying the precious carved
box and Rebecca her satchel and umbrella.</p>

<p>"What you bringin' that everlastin' packet o'
letters for?" Rebecca asked, as they reached the
opening in the wall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to have it out in the light," Ph&oelig;be replied.
"I want to see something."</p>

<p>Outside of the brick wall she paused and opened
the box. It was empty.</p>

<p>"I thought so!" she said.</p>

<p>"Why, ye've brought the box 'thout the letters,
Ph&oelig;be," said Rebecca. "You're not agoin' back for
them, air ye?"</p>

<p>"No," Ph&oelig;be replied, "'twouldn't do any good.
Rebecca. They aren't there."</p>

<p>She dropped the box in the grass and looked wistfully
about her.</p>

<p>"Not there!" said Rebecca, nonplussed. "Why,
who'd take 'em?"</p>

<p>"Nobody. They haven't been written yet."</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;not&mdash;" Rebecca gasped for a moment and
then hurried toward the road. "Come on!" she cried.</p>

<p>Surely, she thought&mdash;surely they must find a doctor
without delay.</p>

<p>But before they reached the road, Rebecca was
glad to pause again and take advantage of a friendly
bush from whose cover she might gaze without being
herself observed.</p>

<p>The broad highway which but so short a time ago
was quite deserted, was now occupied by a double
line of bustling people&mdash;young and old&mdash;men,
women, and children. Those travelling toward their
left, to the north, were principally men and boys,
although now and then a pair of loud-voiced girls
passed northward with male companions. Those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
were travelling southward were the younger ones,
and often whole families together. Among these
the women predominated.</p>

<p>All of these people were laughing&mdash;calling rough
jokes back and forth&mdash;singing, running, jumping,
and dancing, till the whole roadway appeared a merry
Bedlam.</p>

<p>"Must be a county fair near here!" exclaimed Rebecca.
"But will ye listen to the gibberish an' see
their clothes!"</p>

<p>Indeed, the language and the costumes were most
perplexing to good New England ears and eyes, and
Rebecca knew not whether to advance or to retreat.</p>

<p>The women all wore very wide and rather short
skirts, the petticoat worn exposed up to where a full
over-skirt or flounce gave emphasis to their hips. The
elder ones wore long-sleeved jackets and high-crowned
hats, while the young ones wore what looked
like low-necked jerseys tied together in front and
their braided hair hung from uncovered crowns.</p>

<p>The men wore short breeches, some full trunk
hose, some tighter but puffed; their jackets were of
many fashions, from the long-skirted open coats of
the elders to the smart doublets or shirts of the
young men.</p>

<p>The children were dressed like the adults, and
most of them wore wreaths and garlands of flowers,
while in the hands of many were baskets full of
posies.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be gazed from her sister's side with the keen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>est
delight, saying nothing, but turning her eyes
hither and thither as though afraid of losing the least
detail of the scene.</p>

<p>Presently two young girls approached, each with
a basket in her hand. They moved slowly over the
grass, stopping constantly to pick the violets under
their feet. They were so engrossed in their task and
in their conversation that they failed to notice the
two sisters half hidden by the shrubbery.</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;nay!" the taller of the two was saying, "I
tell thee he made oath to't, Cicely. Knew ye ever
Master Stephen to be forsworn?"</p>

<p>"A lover's oaths&mdash;truly!" laughed the other.
"Why, they be made for breaking. I doubt not he
hath made a like vow to a score of silly wenches ere
this, coz!"</p>

<p>"Thou dost him wrong, Cicely. An he keep not
the tryst, 'twill only be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Twill only be thy first misprision, eh?"</p>

<p>"Marry, then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here their words were lost as they continued to
move farther away, still disputing together.</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed Rebecca, turning to Ph&oelig;be.
"Now I know where we've ben carried to. This is
the Holy Land&mdash;Jerusalem or Bethlehem or Canaan
or some sech place. Thou&mdash;thee&mdash;thy! Did ye hear
those girls talkin' Bible language, Ph&oelig;be?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be shook her head and was about to reply
when there was a loud clamour of many tongues from
the road near by.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"The May-pole! The May-pole!" and someone
started a roaring song in which hundreds soon joined.
The sisters could not distinguish the words, but the
volume of sound was tremendous.</p>

<p>There was the tramp of many rushing feet and a
Babel of cries behind them. They turned to see a
party of twenty gayly clad young men bearing down
upon them, carrying a mighty May-pole crowned with
flowers and streaming with colored ribbons.</p>

<p>Around these and following after were three or
four score merry lads and lasses, all running and
capering, shouting and dancing, singly or in groups,
hand in hand.</p>

<p>In a trice Rebecca found herself clinging to Ph&oelig;be
with whom she was borne onward helpless by the
mad throng.</p>

<p>The new-comers were clad in all sorts of fantastic
garbs, and many of them were masked. Ph&oelig;be and
her sister were therefore not conspicuous in their
long scant black skirts and cloth jackets with balloon
sleeves. Their costumes were taken for disguises,
and as they were swallowed up in the mad throng
they were looked on as fellow revellers.</p>

<p>Had Rebecca been alone, she would probably have
succeeded in time in working her way out of this unwelcome
crowd, but to her amazement, no sooner
had they been surrounded by the young roysterers
than Ph&oelig;be, breaking her long silence, seized her
sister by the hand and began laughing, dancing, and
running with the best of them. To crown all, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
was Rebecca's surprise to hear her sister singing word
for word the madcap song of the others, as though
she had known these words all her life. She did not
even skip those parts that made Rebecca blush.</p>

<p>It was incredible&mdash;monstrous&mdash;impossible! Ph&oelig;be,
the sweet, modest, gentle, prudish Ph&oelig;be, singing
a questionable song in a whirl of roystering Jerusalemites!</p>

<p>Up the broad road they danced&mdash;up to the northward,
all men making way for them as, with hand-bag
and umbrella flying in her left hand, she was
dragged forward on an indecorous run by Ph&oelig;be,
who held her tightly by the right.</p>

<p>On&mdash;ever on, past wayside inn and many a lane
and garden, house and hedge. Over the stones and
ruts, choking in clouds of dust.</p>

<p>Once Rebecca stumbled and a great gawky fellow
caught her around the waist to prevent her falling.</p>

<p>"Lips pay forfeit for tripping feet, lass!" he cried,
and kissed her with a sounding smack.</p>

<p>Furious and blushing, she swung her hand-bag in
a circle and brought it down upon the ravisher's head.</p>

<p>"Take that, you everlastin' rascal, you!" she
gasped.</p>

<p>The bumpkin dodged with a laugh and disappeared
in the crowd and dust, cuffing, pushing, scuffling, hugging,
and kissing quite heedless of small rebuffs.</p>

<p>When they had proceeded thus until Rebecca
thought there was nothing left for it but to fall in
her tracks and be trampled to death, the whole crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
came suddenly to a halt, and the young men began
to erect the May-pole in the midst of a shaded green
on one side of the main road.</p>

<p>Rebecca stood, angry and breathless, trying to
flick the dust off her bag with her handkerchief,
while Ph&oelig;be, at her side, her eyes bright and cheeks
rosy, showed her pretty teeth in a broad smile of
pleasure, the while she tried to restore some order
to her hair. As for her hat, that had long ago been
lost.</p>

<p>"I declare&mdash;I declare to goodness!" panted Rebecca,
"ef anybody'd told me ez you, Ph&oelig;be Wise, would
take on so&mdash;so like&mdash;like a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like any Zanny's light-o-love," Ph&oelig;be broke in,
her bosom heaving with the violence of her exercise.
"But prithee, sweet, chide me not. From this on
shall I be chaste, demure, and sober as an abbess in
a play. But oh!&mdash;but oh!" she cried, stretching her
arms high over her head, "'twas a goodly frolic, sis!
I felt a three-centuries' fasting lust for it, in good
sooth!"</p>

<p>Rebecca clutched her sister by the arm and shook
her.</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be Wise&mdash;Ph&oelig;be Wise!" she cried, looking
anxiously into her face, "wake up now&mdash;wake up!
What in the universal airth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A loud shout cut her short, and the two sisters
turned amazed.</p>

<p>"The bull! The bull!"</p>

<p>There was an opening in the crowd as four men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
approached leading and driving a huge angry bull,
which was secured by a ring in his nose to which ropes
were attached. Another man followed, dragged forward
by three fierce bull-dogs in a leash.</p>

<p>The bull was quickly tied to a stout post in the
street, and the crowd formed a circle closely surrounding
the bull-ring. It was the famous bull-ring
of Blackman Street in Southwark.</p>

<p>A moment later the dogs were freed, and amid
their hoarse baying and growling and the deep roaring
of their adversary, the baiting began&mdash;the chief
sport of high and low in the merry days of good
Queen Bess.</p>

<p>The sisters found themselves in the front of the
throng surrounding the raging beasts, and, before she
knew it, Rebecca saw one of the dogs caught on the
horns of the bull and tossed, yelping and bleeding,
into the air.</p>

<p>For one moment she stood aghast in the midst of
the delighted crowd of shouting onlookers. Then
she turned and fiercely elbowed her way outward,
followed by her sister.</p>

<p>"Come 'long&mdash;come 'long, Ph&oelig;be!" she cried.
"We'll soon put a stop to this! I'll find the selectmen
o' this town an' see ef this cruelty to animals
is agoin' on right here in open daylight. I guess
the's laws o' some kind here, ef it <i>is</i> Bethlehem or
Babylon!"</p>

<p>Hot with indignation, the still protesting woman
reached the outskirts of the throng and looked about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
her. Close at hand a tall, swaggering fellow was
loafing about. He was dressed in yellow from head
to foot, save where his doublet and hose were slashed
with dirty red at elbows, shoulders, and hips. A
dirty ruff was around his neck, and on his head he
wore a great shapeless hat peaked up in front.</p>

<p>"Hey, mister!" cried Rebecca, addressing this
worthy. "Can you tell me where I can find one o'
the selectmen?"</p>

<p>The stranger paused in his walk and glanced first
at Rebecca and then, with evidently increased interest,
at Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>"Selectmen?" he asked. "Who hath selected them,
dame?"</p>

<p>He gazed quizzically at the excited woman.</p>

<p>"Now you needn't be funny 'bout it," Rebecca
cried, "fer I'm not goin' to take any impidence. You
know who I mean by the selectmen jest's well as I
do. I'd be obliged to ye ef ye'd tell me the way&mdash;an'
drop that Bible talk&mdash;good every-day English is
good enough fer me!"</p>

<p>"In good sooth, dame," he replied, "'tis not every
day I hear such English as yours."</p>

<p>He paused a moment in thought. This was May-day&mdash;a
season of revelry and good-natured practical
joking. This woman was evidently quizzing him, so
it behooved him to repay her in kind.</p>

<p>"But a truce to quips and quillets, say I," he continued.
"'Twill do me much pleasure an your ladyship
will follow me to the selectman. As it happens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
his honor is even now holding court near London
Bridge."</p>

<p>"London Bridge!" gasped Rebecca. "Why, London
ain't a Bible country, is it?"</p>

<p>Deigning no notice to a query which he did not
understand, the young fellow set off to northward,
followed closely by the two women.</p>

<p>"Keep close to him, Ph&oelig;be," said Rebecca, warningly.
"Ef we should lose the man in all this rabble
o' folks we would not find him in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Thou seest, sweet sister," Ph&oelig;be replied, "'tis
indeed our beloved city of London. Did I not tell
thee yon village was Newington, and here we be now
in Southwark, close to London Bridge."</p>

<p>Rebecca had forgotten her sister's ailment in the
fierce indignation which the bull-baiting had aroused.
But now she was brought back to her own personal
fears and aims with a rude shock by the strange language
Ph&oelig;be held.</p>

<p>She leaped forward eagerly and touched their
guide's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hey, mister!" she exclaimed, "I'd be obliged to
ye if ye'd show us the house o' the nearest doctor
before we see the selectman."</p>

<p>The man stopped short in the middle of the street,
with a cunning leer on his face. The change of purpose
supported his belief that a May-day jest was forward.</p>

<p>"Call me plain Jock Dean, mistress," he said.
"And now tell me further, wilt have a doctor of laws,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of divinity, or of physic. We be in a merry mood
and a generous to-day, and will fetch forth bachelors,
masters, doctors, proctors, and all degrees from Oxford,
Cambridge, or London at a wink's notice. So
say your will."</p>

<p>Rebecca would have returned a sharp reply to this
banter, but she was very anxious to find a physician
for Ph&oelig;be, and so thought it best to take a coaxing
course.</p>

<p>"What I want's a doctor," she said. "I think my
sister's got the shakes or suthin', an' I must take her
to the doctor. Now look here&mdash;you look like a nice
kind of a young man. I know it's some kind of antiques
and horribles day 'round here, an' all the folks
hes on funny clothes and does nothin' on'y joke a
body. But let's drop comical talk jest fer a minute
an' get down to sense, eh?"</p>

<p>She spoke pleadingly, and for a moment Jock
looked puzzled. He only understood a portion of
what she was saying, but he realized that she was
in some sort of trouble.</p>

<p>"Why bait the man with silly questions, Rebecca,"
Ph&oelig;be broke in. "A truce to this silly talk of apothecaries.
I have no need of surgeons, I. My good
fellow," she continued, addressing Jock with an air
of condescension that dumfounded her sister, "is not
yonder the Southwark pillory?"</p>

<p>"Ay, mistress," he replied, with a grin. "It's there
you may see the selectman your serving-maid inquired
for."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Rebecca gasped and clinched her hands fiercely
on her bag and umbrella.</p>

<p>"Serving-maid!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Ahoy&mdash;whoop&mdash;room! Yi&mdash;ki yi!"</p>

<p>A swarm of small white animals ran wildly past
them from behind, and after them came a howling,
laughing, scrambling mob that filled the street.
Someone had loosed a few score rabbits for the delight
of the rabble.</p>

<p>There was no time for reflection. With one accord,
Jock and the two women ran with all speed
toward the pillory and the bridge, driven forward
by the crowd behind them. To have held their
ground would have been to risk broken bones at least.</p>

<p>Fortunately the hunted beasts turned sharply to
the right and left at the first cross street, and soon
the three human fugitives could halt and draw
breath.</p>

<p>They found themselves in the outskirts of a crowd
surrounding the pillory, and above the heads of those
in front they could see a huge red face under a
thatch of tousled hair protruding stiffly through a
hole in a beam supported at right angles to a vertical
post about five feet high. On each side of the head
a large and dirty hand hung through an appropriate
opening in the beam.</p>

<p>Under the prisoner's head was hung an account
of his misdeeds, placed there by some of his cronies.
These crimes were in the nature of certain breaches
of public decorum and decency, the details of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the bystanders were discussing with relish and good-humor.</p>

<p>"Let's get out o' here," said Rebecca, suddenly,
when the purport of what she heard pierced her nineteenth-century
understanding. "These folks beat
me!"</p>

<p>She turned, grasping Ph&oelig;be's arm to enforce her
request, but she found that others had crowded in
behind them and had hemmed them in. This would
not have deterred her but, unaccountably, Ph&oelig;be did
not seem inclined to move.</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;nay!" she said. "'Tis a wanton wastrel,
and he well deserves the pillory. But, Rebecca, I've
a mind to see what observance these people will give
the varlet. Last time I saw one pilloried, alas! they
slew him with shards and paving-stones. This fellow
is liker to be pelted with nosegays, methinks."</p>

<p>"Mercy me, Ph&oelig;be! Whatever&mdash;what&mdash;oh, goodness
gracious grandmother, child!" Poor Rebecca
could find only exclamations wherein to express her
feelings. She began to wonder if she were dreaming.</p>

<p>At this moment a sprightly, dashing lad, in ragged
clothing and bareheaded, sprang to the platform beside
the prisoner and waved his arms for silence.</p>

<p>There were cries of "Hear&mdash;hear!" "Look at Baiting
Will!" "Ho&mdash;ho&mdash;bully rook!" "Sh-sh-h!"</p>

<p>After a time the tumult subsided so that Baiting
Will could make himself heard. He was evidently
a well-known street wag, for his remarks were received
with frequent laughter and vocal applause.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hear ye&mdash;hear ye&mdash;all good folk and merry!" he
shouted. "Here ye see the liege lord of all May
merry-makers. Hail to the King of the May, my
bully boys!"</p>

<p>"Ho&mdash;ho! All hail!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah&mdash;crown him, crown him!"</p>

<p>"The King of the May forever!"</p>

<p>By dint of bawling for silence till he was red in
the face, the speaker at length made himself heard
again.</p>

<p>"What say ye, my good hearts&mdash;shall we have a
double coronation? Where's the quean will be his
consort? Bring her forward, lads. We'll crown the
twain."</p>

<p>This proposal was greeted with a roar of laughter
and approval, and a number of slattern women
showing the effects of strong ale in their faces
stepped boldly forward as competitors for coronation.</p>

<p>But again Baiting Will waved his arms for a
chance to speak.</p>

<p>"Nay, my merry lads and lasses," he cried, "it were
not meet to wed our gracious lord the king without
giving him a chance to choose his queen!"</p>

<p>He leaned his ear close to the grinning head, pretending
to listen a moment. Then, standing forward,
he cried:</p>

<p>"His gracious and sovereign majesty hath bid me
proclaim his choice. He bids ye send him up for
queen yon buxom dame in the black doublet and un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>ruffed
neck&mdash;her wi' the black wand and outland
scrip."</p>

<p>He pointed directly at Rebecca. She turned white
and started to push her way out of the crowd, but
those behind her joined hands, laughing and shouting:
"A queen&mdash;a queen!"</p>

<p>Two or three stout fellows from just beneath the
pillory elbowed their way to her side and grasped
her arms.</p>

<p>She struggled and shrieked in affright.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be with indignant face seized the arm of the
man nearest her and pulled lustily to free her sister.</p>

<p>"Stand aside, you knaves!" she cried, hotly.
"Know your betters and keep your greasy hands
for the sluttish queans of Southwark streets!"</p>

<p>The lads only grinned and tightened their hold.
Rebecca was struggling fiercely and in silence, save
for an occasional shriek of fear.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be raised her voice.</p>

<p>"Good people, will ye see a lady tousled by knavish
street brawlers! What ho&mdash;a rescue&mdash;a Burton&mdash;a
Burton&mdash;a rescue&mdash;ho!"</p>

<p>Her voice rose high above the coarse laughter and
chatter of the crowd.</p>

<p>"What's this? Who calls?"</p>

<p>The crowd parted to right and left with screams
and imprecations, and on a sudden two horsemen
reined up their steeds beside the sisters.</p>

<p>"Back, ye knaves! Unhand the lady!" cried the
younger of the two, striking out with his whip at the
heads of Rebecca's captors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Putting up their hands to ward off these blows,
the fellows hastily retreated a few steps, leaving Rebecca
and Ph&oelig;be standing alone.</p>

<p>"What's here!" cried the young man. "God warn
us, an it be not fair Mistress Burton herself!"</p>

<p>He leaped from his horse, and with the bridle in
one hand and his high-crowned hat in the other, he
advanced, bowing toward the sisters.</p>

<p>He was a strongly built young man of middle
height. His smooth face, broad brow, and pleasant
eyes were lighted up by a happy smile wherein were
shown a set of strong white teeth all too rare in the
England of his time. His abundant blond hair was
cut short on top, but hung down on each side, curling
slightly over his ears. He wore a full-skirted, long-sleeved
jerkin secured by a long row of many small
buttons down the front. A loose lace collar lay flat
over his shoulders and chest. His French hose was
black, and from the tops of his riding-boots there
protruded an edging of white lace.</p>

<p>He wore a long sword with a plain scabbard and
hilt, and on his hands were black gloves, well scented.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be's face wore a smile of pleased recognition,
and she stretched forth her right hand as the cavalier
approached.</p>

<p>"You come in good time, Sir Guy!" she said.</p>

<p>"In very sooth, most fair, most mellific damsel,
your unworthy servitor was erring enchanted in the
paradise of your divine idea when that the horrific
alarum did wend its fear-begetting course through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the labyrinthine corridors of his auricular sensories."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be laughed, half in amusement half in soft
content. Then she turned to Rebecca, who stood
with wide-open eyes and mouth contemplating this
strange apparition.</p>

<p>"Be not confounded, sweetheart," she said. "Have
I not told thee I have ta'en on another's self. Come&mdash;thou
art none the less dear, nor I less thine own."</p>

<p>She stepped forward and put her hand gently on
her sister's.</p>

<p>Rebecca looked with troubled eyes into Ph&oelig;be's
face and said, timidly:</p>

<p>"Won't ye go to a doctor's with me, Ph&oelig;be?"</p>

<p>There was a rude clatter of hoofs as the elder of
the new-comers trotted past the two women and, with
his whip drove back the advancing crowd, which had
begun to close in upon them again.</p>

<p>"You were best mount and away with the ladies,
Sir Guy," he said. "Yon scurvy loons are in poor
humor for dalliance."</p>

<p>With a graceful gesture, Sir Guy invited Ph&oelig;be
to approach his horse. She obeyed, and stepping
upon his hand found herself instantly seated before
his saddle. She seemed to find the seat familiar, and
her heart beat with a pleasure she could scarce explain
when, a moment later, the handsome cavalier
swung into place behind her and put one arm about
her waist to steady her.</p>

<p>Rebecca started forward, terror-stricken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be&mdash;Ph&oelig;be!" she cried. "Ye wouldn't leave
me here!"</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;nay!" said a gruff but kindly voice at her
side. "Here, gi'e us your hand, dame, step on my
foot, and up behind you go."</p>

<p>Sir Guy's horse was turning to go, and in her panic
Rebecca awaited no second bidding, but scrambled
quickly though clumsily to a seat behind the serving-man.</p>

<p>They were all four soon free of the crowd and out
of danger, thanks to the universal respect for rank
and the essential good nature of the May-day gathering.</p>

<p>The horses assumed an easy ambling gait, a sort
of single step which was far more comfortable than
Rebecca had feared she would find it.</p>

<p>The relief of deliverance from the rude mob behind
her gave Rebecca courage, and she gazed about
with some interest.</p>

<p>On either side of the street the houses, which hitherto
had stood apart with gardens and orchards between
them, were now set close together, with the
wide eaves of their sharp gables touching over narrow
and dark alleyways. The architecture was unlike
anything she had ever seen, the walls being built
with the beams showing outside and the windows of
many small diamond-shaped panes.</p>

<p>They had only proceeded a few yards when Rebecca
saw the glint of sunbeams on water before them
and found that they were approaching a great square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
tower, surmounted by numberless poles bearing formless
round masses at their ends.</p>

<p>With one arm around her companion to steady
herself, she held her umbrella and bag tightly in
her free hand. Now she pointed upward with her
umbrella and said:</p>

<p>"Do you mind tellin' me, mister, what's thet fruit
they're a-dryin' up on thet meetin'-house?"</p>

<p>The horseman glanced upward for a moment and
then replied, with something of wonder in his voice:</p>

<p>"Why, those are men's heads, dame. Know you
not London Bridge and the traitors' poles yet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, good land!" said the horrified woman, and
shut her mouth tightly. Evidently England was not
the sort of country she had pictured it.</p>

<p>They rode into a long tunnel under the stones of
this massive tower and emerged to find themselves
upon the bridge. Again and again did they pass
under round-arched tunnels bored, as it were, through
gloomy buildings six or seven stories high. These
covered the bridge from end to end, and they
swarmed with a squalid humanity, if one might judge
from the calls and cries that resounded in the vaulted
passageways and interior courts.</p>

<p>As they finally came out from beneath the last
great rookery, the sisters found themselves in London,
the great and busy city of four hundred thousand
inhabitants.</p>

<p>They were on New Fish Street, and their nostrils
gave them witness of its name at once. Farther up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the slight ascent before them they met other and far
worse smells, and Rebecca was disgusted.</p>

<p>"Where are we goin'?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why, to your mistress' residence, of course."</p>

<p>Rebecca was on the point of objecting to this characterization
of her sister, but she thought better of
it ere she spoke. After all, if these men had done
all this kindness by reason of a mistake, she needed
not to correct them.</p>

<p>The street up which they were proceeding opened
into Gracechurch Street, leading still up the hill and
away from the Thames. It was a fairly broad highway,
but totally unpaved, and disgraced by a ditch
or "kennel" into which found their way the ill-smelling
slops thrown from the windows and doors of the
abutting houses.</p>

<p>"Good land o' Goshen!" Rebecca exclaimed at last.
"Why in goodness' name does all the folks throw
sech messes out in the street?"</p>

<p>"Why, where would you have them throw them,
dame?" asked her companion, in surprise. "Are ye
outlandish bred that ye put me such questions?"</p>

<p>"Not much!" she retorted, hotly. "It's you folks
that's outlandish. Why, where I come from they
hev sewers in the city streets an' pavements an' sidewalks
an' trolley cars. Guess I've ben to Keene, an'
I ought to know."</p>

<p>She tossed her head with the air of one who has
said something conclusive.</p>

<p>The man held his peace for a moment, dumfound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>ed.
Then he laughed heartily, with head thrown
back.</p>

<p>"That's what comes of a kittenish hoyden for a
mistress. Abroad too early, dame, and strong ale
before sunrise! These have stolen away your wits
and made ye hold strange discourse. Sewers&mdash;side-walkers
forsooth&mdash;troll carries, ho&mdash;ho!"</p>

<p>Rebecca grew red with fury. She released her
hold to thump her companion twice on the arm and
nearly fell from the horse in consequence.</p>

<p>"You great rascal!" she cried, indignantly. "How
dare ye talk 'bout drinkin' ale! D'you s'pose I'd
touch the nasty stuff? Me&mdash;a member of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union! Me&mdash;a Daughter
of Temperance an' wearin' the blue ribbon! You'd
ought to be ashamed, that's what you ought!"</p>

<p>But the servant continued to laugh quietly and
Rebecca raged within. Oh how she hated to have
to sit thus close behind a man who had so insulted
her! Clinging to him, too! Clinging for dear life
to a man who accused her of drinking ale!</p>

<p>They turned to the left into Leadenhall Street and
Bucklesbury, where the two women sniffed with delighted
relief the spicy odor of the herbs exposed
on every hand for sale. They left Gresham's Royal
Exchange on the right, and shortly afterward stopped
before the door of one of the many well-to-do houses
of that quarter.</p>

<p>Sir Guy and the two women dismounted, and,
while the groom held the horses, the others ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>proached
the building before which they had
paused.</p>

<p>Rebecca was about to address Ph&oelig;be, whose blushing
face was beaming with pleasure, when the door
was suddenly thrown open and a happy-looking buxom
woman of advanced middle age appeared.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;well!" she cried, holding up her fat
hands in mock amazement. "Out upon thee, Polly,
for a light-headed wench! What&mdash;sneaking out to
an early tryst! Fie, girl!"</p>

<p>"Now, good mine aunt," Ph&oelig;be broke in, with a
smile and a courtsey, "no tryst have I kept, in sooth.
Sir Guy is my witness that he found me quite by
chance."</p>

<p>"In very truth, good Mistress Goldsmith," said the
knight, "it was but the very bounteous guerdon of
fair Dame Fortune that in the auspicious forthcoming
of my steed I found the inexpressible delectancy
of my so great discovery!"</p>

<p>He bowed as he gave back one step and kissed his
hand toward Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>"All one&mdash;all one," said Dame Goldsmith, laughing
as she held out her hand to Ph&oelig;be. "My good
man hath a homily prepared for you, mistress, and
the substance of it runneth on the folly of early
rising on a May-day morning."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be held forth her hand to the knight, who
kissed it with a flourish, hat in hand.</p>

<p>"Shall I hear from thee soon?" she said, in an undertone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forthwith, most fairly beautiful&mdash;most gracious
rare!" he replied.</p>

<p>Then, leaping on his horse, he dashed down the
street at a mad gallop, followed closely by his groom.</p>

<p>Rebecca stood stupefied, gazing first at one and
then at the other, till she was rudely brought to her
senses by no other than Dame Goldsmith herself.</p>

<p>"What, Rebecca!" she exclaimed. "Hast breakfasted,
woman&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Ay, aunt," Ph&oelig;be broke in, hurriedly. "Rebecca
must to my chamber to tire me ere I see mine uncle.
Prithee temper the fury of his homily, sweet aunt."</p>

<p>Taking the dame's extended hand, she suffered
herself to be led within, followed by Rebecca, too
amazed to speak.</p>

<p>On entering the street door they found themselves
in a large hall, at the farther end of which a bright
wood fire was burning, despite the season. A black
oak table was on one side of the room against the
wall, upon which were to be seen a number of earthen
beakers and a great silver jug or tankard. A carved
and cushioned settle stood against the opposite wall,
and besides two comfortable arm-chairs at the two
chimney-corners there were two or three heavy chairs
of antique pattern standing here and there. The
floor was covered with newly gathered fresh-smelling
rushes.</p>

<p>A wide staircase led to the right, and to this Ph&oelig;be
turned at once as though she had always lived there.</p>

<p>"Hast heard from my father yet?" she asked, paus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>ing
upon the first stair and addressing Dame Goldsmith.</p>

<p>"Nay, girl. Not so much as a word. I trow he'll
have but little to say to me. Ay&mdash;ay&mdash;a humorous
limb, thy father, lass."</p>

<p>She swept out of the room with a toss of the head,
and Ph&oelig;be smiled as she turned to climb the stairs.
Immediately she turned again and held out one hand
to Rebecca.</p>

<p>"Come along, Rebecca. Let's run 'long up," she
said, relapsing into her old manner.</p>

<p>She led the way without hesitation to a large, light
bedroom, the front of which hung over the street.
Here, too, the floor was covered with sweet rushes,
a fact which Rebecca seemed to resent.</p>

<p>"Why the lands sakes do you suppose these London
folks dump weeds on their floors?" she asked.
"An' look there at those two beds, still unmade and
all tumbled disgraceful!"</p>

<p>"Why, there's where we slept last night, Rebecca,"
said Ph&oelig;be, laughing as she dropped into a chair.
"As for the floors," she continued, "they're always
that way when folks ain't mighty rich. The lords
and all have carpets and rugs."</p>

<p>Rebecca, stepping very high to avoid stumbling
in the rushes, moved over to the dressing-table and
proceeded to remove her outer wraps, having first
deposited her bag and umbrella on a chair.</p>

<p>"I don't see how in gracious you know so much
about it," she remarked, querulously. "'Pon my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
word, you acted with that young jackanapes an' that
fat old lady downstairs jest's ef you'd allus known
em."</p>

<p>"Well, so I have," Ph&oelig;be replied, smiling. "I
knew them all nearly three hundred years before
you were born, Rebecca Wise."</p>

<p>Rebecca dropped into a chair and looked helplessly
at her sister with her arms hanging at her sides.</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be Wise&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"No, not now!" Ph&oelig;be exclaimed, stopping her
sister with a gesture. "You must call me Mistress
Mary. I'm Mary Burton, daughter of Isaac Burton,
soon to be Sir Isaac Burton, of Burton Hall. You
are my dear old tiring-woman&mdash;my sometime nurse&mdash;and
thou must needs yield me the respect and obedience
as well as the love thou owest, thou fond old
darling!"</p>

<p>The younger woman threw her arms about the
other's neck and kissed her repeatedly.</p>

<p>Rebecca sat mute and impassive, making no return.</p>

<p>"Seems as though I ought to wake up soon now,"
she muttered, weakly.</p>

<p>"Come, Rebecca," Ph&oelig;be exclaimed, briskly, stepping
to a high, carved wardrobe beside her bed, "this
merry-making habit wearies me. Let us don a fitter
attire. Come&mdash;lend a hand, dearie&mdash;be quick!"</p>

<p>Rebecca sat quite still, watching her sister as she
proceeded to change her garments, taking from wardrobe
and tiring chest her wide skirts, long-sleeved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
jacket, and striped under-vest with a promptitude
and readiness that showed perfect familiarity with
her surroundings.</p>

<p>"There," thought Rebecca, "I have it! She's been
reading those old letters and looking at that ivory
picture so long she thinks that she's the girl in the
picture herself, now. Yes, that's it. Mary Burton
was the name!"</p>

<p>When Ph&oelig;be was new-dressed, her sister could
not but acknowledge inwardly that the queer clothes
were mightily becoming. She appeared the beau
ideal of a merry, light-hearted, healthy girl from
the country.</p>

<p>On one point, however, Rebecca could not refrain
from expostulating.</p>

<p>"Look a-here, Ph&oelig;be," she said, in a scandalized
voice, as she rose and faced her sister, "ain't you goin'
to put on somethin' over your chest? That ain't
decent the way you've got yerself fixed now!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried Ph&oelig;be, with a mischievous
twinkle in her eye. "Wouldst have me cover my
breast like a married woman! Look to thine own
attire. Come, where hast put it?"</p>

<p>Rebecca put her hands on her hips and looked into
her sister's face with a stern determination.</p>

<p>"Ef you think I'm agoin' to put on play-actor
clothes an' go round lookin' indecent, Ph&oelig;be Wise,
why, you're mistaken&mdash;'cause I ain't&mdash;so there!"</p>

<p>"Nay, nurse!" Ph&oelig;be exclaimed, earnestly. "'Tis
the costume thou art wearing now that is mummer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
weeds. Come, sweet&mdash;come! They'll not yield thee
admittance below else."</p>

<p>She concluded with a warning inflection, and shook
her finger affectionately at her sister.</p>

<p>Rebecca opened her mouth several times and
closed it again in despair ere she could find a reply.
At length she seated herself slowly, folded her arms,
and said:</p>

<p>"They can do jest whatever they please downstairs,
Ph&oelig;be. As fer me, I'd sooner be seen in my nightgown
than in the flighty, flitter-scatter duds the
women 'round here wear. Not but you look good
enough in 'em, if you'd cover your chest, but play-actin'
is meant for young folks&mdash;not fer old maids
like me."</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What the lands sakes d'ye holler neigh all the
time fer? I'm not agoin' to neigh, an' you might's
well make up your mind to't."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be bit her lips and then, after a moment's
hesitation, turned to the door.</p>

<p>"Well, well! E'en have it thy way!" she said.</p>

<p>Followed by Rebecca, the younger woman descended
the stairs. As she reached the entrance hall,
she stopped short at sight of a tall, heavy man standing
beside the table across the room with his face
buried in a great stone mug.</p>

<p>He had dropped his flat round hat upon the table,
and his long hair fell in a sort of bush to his wide,
white-frilled ruff. He wore a long-skirted, loose coat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of green cloth with yellow fringe, provided with
large side-pockets, but without a belt. The sleeves
were loose, but brought in tightly at the wrists by
yellow bands. His green hose were of the short and
tight French pattern, and he wore red stockings and
pointed shoes of Spanish leather.</p>

<p>As he removed the cup with a deep sigh of satisfaction,
there was revealed a large, cheerful red face
with a hooked nose between bushy brows overhanging
large blue eyes.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be stood upon the lowest stair in smiling silence
and with folded hands as he caught her eye.</p>

<p>"Ha, thou jade!" cried Master Goldsmith, for he
it was. "Wilt give me the slip of a May-day morn!"</p>

<p>He set down his cup with a loud bang and strode
over to the staircase, shaking his finger playfully at
his niece.</p>

<p>Rebecca had just time to notice that his long, full
beard and mustache were decked with two or three
spots of froth when, to her great indignation, Ph&oelig;be
was folded in his arms and soundly kissed on both
cheeks.</p>

<p>"There, lass!" he chuckled, as he stepped back,
rubbing his hands. "I told thy aunt I'd make thee
do penance for thy folly."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be wiped her cheeks with her handkerchief
and tipped her head impudently at the cheerful ravisher.</p>

<p>"Now, God mend your manners, uncle!" she exclaimed.
"What! Bedew my cheeks with the froth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of good ale on your beard while my throat lacks the
good body o't! Why, I'm burned up wi' thirst!"</p>

<p>"Good lack!" cried the goldsmith, turning briskly
to the table. "Had ye no drink when ye first returned,
then?"</p>

<p>He poured a smaller cupful of foaming ale from
the great silver jug and brought it to Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>Rebecca clutched the stair-rail for support, and,
with eyes ready to start from her head, she leaned
forward, incredulous, as Ph&oelig;be took the cup from
the merchant's hand.</p>

<p>Then she could keep silence no longer.</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be Wise!" she screamed, "be you goin' to
drink ALE!"</p>

<p>No words can do justice to the awful emphasis
which she laid upon that last dread word.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be turned and looked up roguishly at her sister,
who was still half-way up the stairs. The young
girl's left hand leaned on her uncle's arm, while with
her right she extended the cup in salutation.</p>

<p>"Here's thy good health, nurse&mdash;and to our better
acquaintance," she laughed.</p>

<p>Rebecca uttered one short scream and fled up to
their bed-room. She had seen the impossible. Her
sister Ph&oelig;be with her face buried in a mug of ale!</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">HOW FRANCIS BACON CHEATED THE BAILIFFS</h3>


<p>It was at about this time that Copernicus Droop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
finally awakened. He lay perfectly still for a minute
or two, wondering where he was and what had
happened. Then he began to mutter to himself.</p>

<p>"Machinery's stopped, so we're on dry land," he
said. Then, starting up on one elbow, he listened
intently.</p>

<p>Within the air-ship all was perfect silence, but
from without there came in faintly occasional symptoms
of life&mdash;the bark of a dog, a loud laugh, the
cry of a child.</p>

<p>Droop slowly came to his feet and gazed about.
A faint gleam of daylight found its way past the
closed shutters. He raised the blinds and blinked
as he gazed out into a perfect thicket of trees and
shrubbery, beyond which here and there he thought
he could distinguish a high brick wall.</p>

<p>"Well, we're in the country, anyhow!" he muttered.</p>

<p>He turned and consulted the date indicator in the
ceiling.</p>

<p>"May 1, 1598," he said. "Great Jonah! but we
hev whirled back fer keeps! I s'pose we jest whirled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
till she broke loose."</p>

<p>He gazed about him and observed that the two
state-room doors were open. He walked over and
looked in.</p>

<p>"I wonder where them women went," he said.
"Seems like they were in a tremendous hurry 'bout
gettin' way. Lucky 'tain't a city we're in, 'cause
they might'v got lost in the city."</p>

<p>After an attempt to improve his somewhat rumpled
exterior, he made his way down the stairs and
out into the garden. Once here, he quickly discovered
the building which had arrested the attention
of the two women, but it being now broad daylight,
he was able thoroughly to satisfy himself that chance
had brought the Panchronicon into the deserted garden
of a deserted mansion.</p>

<p>"Wal, we'll be private an' cosy here till the Panchronicon
hez time to store up more force," he said
out loud.</p>

<p>Strolling forward, he skirted the high wall, and
ere long discovered the very opening through which
the sisters had passed at sunrise.</p>

<p>Stepping through the breach, he found himself,
as they had done, near the main London highway
in Newington village. The hurly-burly of sunrise
had abated by this time, for wellnigh all the villagers
were absent celebrating the day around
their respective May-poles or at bear or bull-baiting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>With his hands behind him, he walked soberly up
and down for a few minutes, carefully surveying the
pretty wooden houses, the church in the distance, and
the stones of the churchyard on the green hill-slope
beyond. The architecture was not entirely unfamiliar.
He had seen such in books, he felt sure, but he
could not positively identify it. Was it Russian,
Japanese, or Italian?</p>

<p>Suddenly a distant cry came to his ears.</p>

<p>"Hi&mdash;Lizzie&mdash;Lizzie, wench! Come, drive the pig
out o' the cabbages!"</p>

<p>He stopped short and slapped his thigh.</p>

<p>"English!" he exclaimed. "'Tain't America,
that's dead sure. Then it's England. England in
1598," he continued, scratching his head. "Let's see.
Who in Sam Hill was runnin' things in 1598? Richard
Coor de Lion&mdash;Henry Eight&mdash;no&mdash;or was it Joan
of Arc? Be darned ef I know!"</p>

<p>He looked about him again and selected a neighboring
house which he thought promised information.</p>

<p>He went to the front door and knocked. There
was no reply, despite many attempts to arouse the
inmates.</p>

<p>"Might ha' known," he muttered, and started
around the house, where he found a side door half
hidden beneath the projection of an upper story.</p>

<p>Here his efforts were rewarded at last by the appearance
of a very old woman in a peaked hat and
coif, apparently on the point of going out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Looks like a witch in the story-books," he
thought, but his spoken comment was more polite.</p>

<p>"Good-mornin', ma'am," he said. "Would you be
so kind as to tell me the name of this town?"</p>

<p>"This be Newington," she replied, in a high,
cracked voice.</p>

<p>"Newington," he replied, with a nod and a smile
intended to express complete enlightenment. "Ah,
yes&mdash;Newington. Quite a town!"</p>

<p>"Is that all you'd be askin', young man?" said the
old woman, a little suspiciously, eying his strange
garb.</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;no&mdash;that is, can you tell me how far
it is to London?" This was the only English city of
which he had any knowledge, so he naturally sought
to identify his locality by reference to it.</p>

<p>"Lunnun," said the woman. "Oh, it'll be a matter
of a mile or better!"</p>

<p>Droop was startled, but highly pleased. Here was
luck indeed.</p>

<p>"Thank you, ma'am," he said. "Good-mornin',"
and with a cheerful nod, he made off.</p>

<p>The fact is that this information opened up a new
field of enterprise and hope. At once there leaped
into his mind an improved revival of his original
plan. If he could have made a fortune with his great
inventions in 1876, what might he not accomplish
by the same means in 1598! He pictured to himself
the delight of the ancient worthies when they
heard the rag-time airs and minstrel jokes produced
by his phonograph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"By hockey!" he exclaimed, in irrepressible delight,
"I'll make their gol darned eyes pop out!"</p>

<p>As he marched up and down in the deserted garden,
hidden by the friendly brick wall, he bitterly
regretted that he had limited himself to so few modern
inventions.</p>

<p>"Ef I'd only known I was comin' this fur back!"
he exclaimed, as he talked to himself that he might
feel less lonely. "Ef I'd only known, I could hev
brought a heap of other things jest's well as not.
Might hev taught 'em 'bout telegraphin' an' telephones.
Could ha' given 'em steam-engines an' parlor
matches. By ginger!" he exclaimed, "I b'lieve
I've got some parlor matches. Great Jehosaphat!
Won't I get rich!"</p>

<p>But at this a new difficulty presented itself to his
mind. He foresaw no trouble in procuring patents
for his inventions, but how about the capital for their
exploitation? Presumably this was quite as necessary
here in England as it would have been in America
in 1876. Unfortunately, his original plan was
impossible of fulfilment. Rebecca had failed him
as a capitalist. Besides, she and Ph&oelig;be had both
completely disappeared.</p>

<p>It was long before he saw his way out of this difficulty,
but by dint of persistent pondering he finally
lit upon a plan.</p>

<p>He had brought with him a camera, several hundred
plates, and a complete developing and printing
outfit. He determined to set up as a professional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
photographer. His living would cost him nothing,
as the Panchronicon was well stored with provisions.
To judge by his surroundings, his privacy would probably
be respected. Then, by setting up as a photographer
he would at least earn a small amount of
current coin and perhaps attract some rich and powerful
backer by the novelty and excellence of his
process. On this chance he relied for procuring the
capital which was undoubtedly necessary for his
purpose.</p>

<p>By noon of the next day he had begun operations,
having taken two or three views of familiar scenes
in the neighborhood, which he affixed as samples
to a large cardboard sign on which he had printed,
in large type:</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="border2">
<h3>AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHER<br />
<small>THE ONLY ONE IN EXISTENCE</small></h3>

<h3><i>Step up and have your picture taken</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>This sign he nailed to a tree near the road which
he made his headquarters. He preferred to keep the
location and nature of his abode a secret, and so spent
his days under his tree or sitting in the porch of some
neighboring house, for he was not long in making
friends, and his marvellous tales made him very
popular.</p>

<p>It was difficult for him to fix a price at first, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
being acquainted with the coin of the realm, but he
put his whole mind to the acquisition of reliable information
on this point, and his native shrewdness
brought him success.</p>

<p>He found that it was wisest for every reason to
let it be believed that the pictures were produced
by hand. The camera, he explained, was a mere aid
to accuracy of observation and memory in reproduction
of what he saw through it. Thus he was able
to command much higher prices for the excellence
and perfection of his work and, had he but known it,
further avoided suspicion of witchcraft which would
probably have attached to him had he let it be known
that the camera really produced the picture.</p>

<p>In the course of his daily gossip with neighbors
and with the customers, rustic and urban, who were
attracted by his fame, he soon learned that "Good
Queen Bess" ruled the land, and his speech gradually
took on a tinge of the Elizabethan manner and
vocabulary which, mingling with his native New
England idioms, produced a very picturesque effect.</p>

<p>It was a warm night some weeks after Droop had
"hung out his shingle" as a professional photographer
that he sat in the main room of the Panchronicon,
reading for perhaps the twentieth time Ph&oelig;be's famous
book on Bacon and Shakespeare, which she had
left behind. The other books on hand he found too
dry, and he whiled away his idle hours with this invaluable
historic work, feeling that its tone was in
harmony with his recent experiences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>So to-night he was reading with the shutters tightly
closed to prevent attracting the gaze of outsiders.
No one had yet discovered his residence, and he had
flattered himself that it would remain permanently
a secret.</p>

<p>His surprise and consternation were great, therefore,
when he was suddenly disturbed in his reading
by a gentle knocking on the door at the foot of the
stairs.</p>

<p>"Great Jonah!" he exclaimed, closing his book and
cocking his head to listen. "Now, who&mdash;wonder ef
it's Cousin Rebecca or Ph&oelig;be!"</p>

<p>The knock was repeated.</p>

<p>"Why, 'f course 'tis!" he said. "Couldn't be anybody
else. Funny they never come back sooner!"</p>

<p>He laid his book upon the table and started down
the stairs just as the knocking was heard for the
third time.</p>

<p>"Comin'&mdash;comin'!" he cried. "Save the pieces!"</p>

<p>He threw open the door and started back in alarm
as there entered a strange man wrapped in a black
cloak, which he held so as to completely hide his
features.</p>

<p>The new-comer sprang into the little hallway and
hastily closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>"Close in the light, friend," he said.</p>

<p>Then, glancing about him, he ascended the stairs
and entered the main room above.</p>

<p>Droop followed him closely, rubbing his hand
through his hair in perplexity. This intrusion threat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>ened
to spoil his plans. It would never do to have
the neighbors swarming around the Panchronicon.</p>

<p>The stranger threw off his cloak on entering the
upper room and turned to face his host.</p>

<p>"I owe you sincere acknowledgment of thanks,
good sir," he said, gravely.</p>

<p>He appeared to be about thirty-five years of age,
a man of medium stature, dark of hair and eyes, with
a pale, intellectual face and a close-clipped beard.
His entire apparel was black, save for his well-starched
ruff of moderate depth and the lace ruffles
at his wrists.</p>

<p>"Wal, I dunno," Droop retorted. "Marry, an I
hed known as thou wast not an acquaintance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You would not have given me admittance?"</p>

<p>The calm, dark eyes gazed with disconcerting
steadiness into Droop's face.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;I ain't sayin'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hope I have not intruded to your hurt or serious
confusion, friend," said the stranger, glancing
about him. "To tell the very truth, your hospitable
shelter hath offered itself in the hour of need."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;doth it raineth&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"What can I do fer ye? Take a seat," said Droop,
as the stranger dropped into a chair. "Thou knowest,
forsooth, that I don't take photygraphs at night&mdash;marry,
no!"</p>

<p>"Are you, then, the new limner who makes pictures
by aid of the box and glass?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yea&mdash;that's what I am," said Droop.</p>

<p>"I was ignorant of the location of your dwelling.
Indeed, it is pure accident&mdash;a trick of Fortune that
hath brought me to your door to-night."</p>

<p>Droop seated himself and directed an interrogative
gaze at his visitor.</p>

<p>"My name's Droop&mdash;Copernicus Droop," he said.
"An' you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My name is Francis Bacon, Master Droop&mdash;your
servitor," he bowed slightly.</p>

<p>Droop started up stiff and straight in his chair.</p>

<p>"Francis Bacon!" he exclaimed. "What! Not
the one as wrote Shakespeare?"</p>

<p>"Shakespeare&mdash;Shakespeare!" said the stranger,
in a slow, puzzled tone. "I do admit having made
some humble essays in writing&mdash;certain modest commentaries
upon human motives and relations&mdash;but,
in good sooth, the title you have named,
Master Droop, is unknown to me. Shakespeare&mdash;Shakespeare.
Pray, sir, is it a homily or an
essay?"</p>

<p>"Why, ye see, et's&mdash;as fur's I know it's a man&mdash;a
sorter poet or genius or play-writin' man," said
Droop, somewhat confused.</p>

<p>"A man&mdash;a poet&mdash;a genius?" Bacon repeated,
gravely. "Then, prithee, friend, how meant you in
saying you thought me him who had written Shakespeare?
Can a man&mdash;a poet&mdash;be written?"</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;verily&mdash;in good sooth&mdash;marry, no!" stuttered
Droop. "What they mean is thet 'twas you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
wrote the things Shakespeare put his name to&mdash;you
did, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Ahem!" said the stranger, with dubious slowness.
"A poet&mdash;a genius, you say? And I understand that
I am reputed to have been the true author of&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed&mdash;yea&mdash;la!" exclaimed Droop, now
sadly confused.</p>

<p>"Might I ask the name of some work imputed to
me, and which this&mdash;this Shake&mdash;eh&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shakespeare."</p>

<p>"Ay, this Shakespeare hath impudently claimed
for his own credit and reputation?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;why&mdash;suffer me&mdash;jest wait a minute,"
said Droop. He clutched the book he had been
reading and opened it at random. "Here," he said.
"'Love's Labor's Lost,' for instance."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Bacon, starting indignantly to
his feet. "'Tis but a sennight I saw this same dull
nonsense played by the Lord Chamberlain's players.
'Love's Labor's&mdash;" he broke off and repressed his
choler with some effort. Then in a slow, grave voice
he continued: "Why, sir, you have been sadly abused.
Surely the few essays I have made in the field of
letters may stand my warrant that I should not so
demean myself as is implied in this repute of me.
Pray tell me, sir, who are they that so besmirch my
reputation as to impute to my poor authority the
pitiful lines of this rascal player?"</p>

<p>"Why, in very truth&mdash;marry, it's in that book.
It was printed in Chicago."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Bacon glanced contemptuously at the volume without
deigning to open it.</p>

<p>"And prithee, Master Droop, where may Chicago
be?"</p>

<p>"Why it <i>was</i> in&mdash;no! I mean it will be&mdash;oh, darn
it all! Chicago's in Illinois."</p>

<p>"Illinois&mdash;yes&mdash;and Illinois?" Bacon's dark eyes
were turned in grave question upon his companion.</p>

<p>"Why, that's in America, ye know."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Bacon. Then, with a sigh of great
relief: "Ah!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yea, verily&mdash;in sooth&mdash;or&mdash;or thereabouts," said
Droop, not knowing what to say.</p>

<p>"Ah, in America! A land of heathen savages&mdash;red-skinned
hunters of men. Yes&mdash;yes! 'Twere not
impossible such persons might so misapprehend my
powers. 'Twould lie well within their shallow incapacities,
methinks, to impute to Francis Bacon,
Barrister of Gray's Inn, Member of Parliament for
Melcombe, Reversionary Clerk of the Star Chamber,
the friend of the Earl of Essex&mdash;to impute to me, I
say, these frothings of a villain player&mdash;this Shake&mdash;eh?
What?"</p>

<p>"Shakespeare."</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>Bacon paced placidly up and down for a few moments,
while Droop followed him apologetically with
his eyes. Evidently this was a most important personage.
It behooved him to conciliate such a power
as this. Who could tell! Perhaps this friend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the Earl of Essex might be the capitalist for whom
he was in search.</p>

<p>For some time Master Bacon paced back and forth
in silence, evidently wrapped in his own thoughts.
In the meantime Droop's hopes rose higher and
higher, and at length he could no longer contain
himself.</p>

<p>"Why, Master Bacon," he said, "I'm clean surprised&mdash;yea,
marry, am I&mdash;that anybody could hev
ben sech a fool&mdash;a&mdash;eh? Well, a loon&mdash;what?&mdash;as
to hev said you wrote Shakespeare. You're a man
o' science&mdash;that's what you are. You don't concern
yourself with no trumpery poetry. I can see that
stickin' out."</p>

<p>Bacon was startled and examined himself hurriedly.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed, "what is sticking out,
friend?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I was jest sayin' it in the sense of the word!"
said Droop, apologetically. "What I mean is, it's
clear that you're not a triflin' poet, but a man of
science&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Why, no. I do claim some capacity in the diviner
flights of lyric letters, friend. You are not
to despise poetry. Nay&mdash;rather contemn those who
bring scorn to the name of poet&mdash;vain writers
for filthy pence&mdash;fellows like this same Shakespeare."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that's what I meant," said Droop, anxious
to come to the point. "But your high-water mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
is science&mdash;philosophy&mdash;all that. Now, you're somethin'
of a capitalist, too, I surmise."</p>

<p>He paused expectant.</p>

<p>"A what, friend?"</p>

<p>"Why, you're in some Trust er other, ain't ye?&mdash;Member
of Congress&mdash;I mean Parlyment&mdash;friend of
Lord What's-'is-name&mdash;Clerk of the Star&mdash;suthin' or
other. Guess you're pretty middlin' rich, ain't ye?"</p>

<p>Bacon's face grew long at these words, and he
seated himself in evident melancholy.</p>

<p>"Why, to speak truth, friend," he said, "I find
myself at this moment in serious straits. Indeed, 'tis
an affair of a debt that hath driven me thus to your
door."</p>

<p>"A debt!" said Droop, his heart sinking.</p>

<p>"Ay. The plain truth is, that at this moment I
am followed by two bailiffs&mdash;bearers of an execution
of arrest upon my person. 'Twas to evade these
fellows that I entered this deserted garden, leaving
my horse without. 'Tis for this cause I am here.
Now, Master Droop, you know the whole truth."</p>

<p>"Great Jonah!" said Droop, helplessly. "But
didn't you say you had friends?"</p>

<p>"None better, Master Droop. My uncle is Lord
Burleigh&mdash;Lord High Treasurer to her Gracious
Majesty. My patron is the Earl of Essex&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why don't they give ye a lift?"</p>

<p>Bacon's face grew graver.</p>

<p>"Essex is away," he said. "On his return my necessities
will be speedily relieved. As for mine uncle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to him have I applied; but his lordship lives in the
sunshine of her Majesty's smiles, and he cannot be
too sudden in aid of Francis Bacon for fear of losing
the Queen's favor else."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"A long tale of politics, friend. A speech made
by me in Parliament in opposing monopolies."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Droop, dismally. "You're down on
monopolies, air ye?"</p>

<p>Bacon turned a wary eye upon his companion.</p>

<p>"Why ask you this?" he said.</p>

<p>"Why, only to&mdash;" He paused. "To say sooth,"
he continued, with sudden resolution, "I want to get
a monopoly myself&mdash;two or three of 'em. I've got
some A1 inventions here, an' I want to get 'em patented.
I thought, perhaps, you or your friends might
help me."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Bacon exclaimed, with awakening interest.
"You seek my influence in furtherance of these designs.
Do I apprehend you?"</p>

<p>"That's jest it," said Droop.</p>

<p>"And what would be the&mdash;ahem&mdash;the recognition
which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, you'd git a quarter interest in the hull business,"
said Droop, hopefully. "That is, provided
you've got the inflooence, ye know."</p>

<p>"Too slight&mdash;too slight for Francis Bacon, Master
Droop."</p>

<p>Copernicus thought rapidly for a minute or two.
Then he pretended indifference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, very good!" he said. "I'll take up with Sir
Thomas Thingumbob&mdash;What's-'is-name."</p>

<p>Bacon pretended to accept the decision and
changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Now permit me to approach the theme of my
immediate need," he said. "These bailiffs without&mdash;they
must be evaded. May I have your assistance,
friend, in this matter?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what can I do?"</p>

<p>"Pray observe me with all attention," Bacon began.
"These my habiliments are of the latest fashion
and of rich texture. Your habit is, if I may so speak,
of inferior fashion and substance. I will exchange
my habit for yours on this condition&mdash;that you
mount my horse forthwith and ride away. The
moon is bright and you will be pursued at once by
these scurvy bailiffs. Lead them astray, Master
Droop, to the southward, whilst I slip away to London
in your attire, wherein I feel sure no man will
recognize me. Once in London, there is a friend
of mine&mdash;one Master Isaac Burton&mdash;who is hourly
expected and from whom I count upon having some
advances to stand me in present stead. What say
you? Will you accept new clothing and rich&mdash;for
old and worn?"</p>

<p>Droop approached his visitor and slowly examined
his clothing, gravely feeling the stuff between thumb
and finger and even putting his hand inside the
doublet to feel the lining. Bacon's outraged dignity
struggled within him with the sense of his necessity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Finally, just as he was about to give violent expression
to his impatience, Droop stepped back and took
in the general effect with one eye closed and his head
cocked on one side.</p>

<p>"Jest turn round, will ye?" he said, with a whirling
movement of the hand, "an' let me see how it
looks in the back?"</p>

<p>Biting his lips, the furious barrister turned about
and walked away.</p>

<p>"Needs must where the devil drives," he muttered.</p>

<p>Droop shook his head dismally.</p>

<p>"Marry, come up!" he exclaimed. "I guess I can't
make the bargain, friend Bacon."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"I don't like the cut o' them clothes. I'd look
rideec'lous in 'em. Besides, the's too much risk in
it, Bacon, my boy," he said, familiarly, throwing
himself into the arm-chair and stretching out his legs
comfortably. "Ef the knaves was to catch me an'
find out the trick I'd played 'em, why, sure as a gun,
they'd put me in the lock-up an' try me fer stealin'
your duds&mdash;your habiliments."</p>

<p>"Nay, then," Bacon exclaimed, eagerly, "I'll give
you a writing, Master Droop, certifying that the
clothes were sold to you for a consideration. That
will hold you blameless. What say you?"</p>

<p>"What about the horse and the saddle and bridle?"</p>

<p>"These are borrowed from a friend, Master
Droop," said Bacon. "These rascals know this, else
had they seized them in execution."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, but won't they seize your clothes, Brother
Bacon?" said Droop, slyly.</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;that were unlawful. A man's attire is free
from process of execution."</p>

<p>"I'll tell ye wherein I'll go ye," said Droop, with
sudden animation. "You give me that certificate,
that bill of sale, you mentioned, and also a first-class
letter to some lord or political chap with a pull at
the Patent Office, an' I'll change clothes with ye an'
fool them bailiff chaps."</p>

<p>"I'll e'en take your former offer, then," said Bacon,
with a sigh. "One fourth part of all profits was
the proposal, was it not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all off!" said Droop, grandly, with a
wave of the hand. "If I go out an' risk my neck in
them skin-tight duds o' yourn, I get the hull profits
an' you get to London safe an' sound in these New
Hampshire pants."</p>

<p>"But, good sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take it or leave it, friend."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bacon, angrily, after a few moments'
hesitation, "have your will. Give me ink, pen, and
paper."</p>

<p>These being produced, the barrister curiously examined
the wooden penholder and steel pen.</p>

<p>"Why, Master Droop," he said, "from what unknown
bird have you plucked forth this feather?"</p>

<p>"Feather!" Droop exclaimed. "What feather?"</p>

<p>"Why this?" Bacon held up the pen and holder.</p>

<p>"That ain't a feather. It's a pen-holder an' a steel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
pen, man. Say!" he exclaimed, leaning forward
suddenly. "Ye hain't ben drinkin', hev ye?"</p>

<p>To this Bacon only replied by a dignified stare and
turned in silence to the table.</p>

<p>"Which you agoin' to write first," said Droop, considerately
dropping the question he had raised.</p>

<p>"The bill of sale."</p>

<p>"All right. I'd like to have ye put the one about
the patent real strong. I don't want to fail on the
fust try, you know."</p>

<p>Bacon made no reply, but dipped his pen and set
to work. In due time the two documents were indited
and carefully signed.</p>

<p>"This letter is addressed to my uncle, Lord Burleigh,"
said Bacon. "He is at the Palace at Greenwich,
with the Queen."</p>

<p>"Shall I hev to take it to him myself?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly."</p>

<p>"Might hev trouble findin' him, I should think,"
said Droop.</p>

<p>"Mayhap. On more thought, 'twere better you
had a guide. I know a worthy gentleman&mdash;one of
the Queen's harbingers. Take you this letter to him,
for which purpose I will e'en leave it unsealed that
he may read it. He will conduct you to mine uncle,
for he hath free access to the court."</p>

<p>"What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Sir Percevall Hart. His is the demesne with the
high tower of burnt bricks, near the west end of
Tower Street. But stay! 'Twere better you did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
seek him at the Boar's Head Tavern in Eastcheap."</p>

<p>"Sir Percevall Hart&mdash;Boar's Head&mdash;Eastcheap.
That's in London City, I s'pose."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," said Bacon, impatiently. "Any watchman
or passer-by will direct you. Now, sir, 'tis for
you to fulfil your promise."</p>

<p>"All right," said Droop. "It's my innin's&mdash;so here
goes."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the two men had changed their
costumes and stood looking at each other with a very
evident disrelish of their respective situations.</p>

<p>Droop held his chin high in the air to avoid contact
with the stiff ruff, while his companion turned
up the collar of his nineteenth-century coat and held
it together in front as though he feared taking cold.</p>

<p>"Why, Master Droop," said Bacon, glancing down
in surprise at his friend's nether extremities, "what
giveth that unwonted spiral look to your legs? They
be ribbed as with grievous weals."</p>

<p>Droop tried to look down, but his wide ruff prevented
him. So he put one foot on the table and,
bringing his leg to the horizontal, gazed dismally
down upon it.</p>

<p>"Gosh all hemlock&mdash;them's my underdrawers!" he
exclaimed. "These here ding-busted long socks o'
yourn air so all-fired tight the blamed drawers hez
hiked up in ridges all round! Makes me look like
a bunch o' bananas in a bag!" he said, crossly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;a truce to trivial complaints," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Bacon, hurriedly, fearful that Droop might withdraw
his consent to the rescue. "Here are my cloak
and hat, friend; and now away, I pray you, and remember&mdash;ride
to southward, that I may have a clear
field to London."</p>

<p>Droop donned the hat and cloak and gazed at himself
sorrowfully in the glass.</p>

<p>"Darned ef I don't look like a cross 'tween a Filipino
and a crazy cowboy!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"And think you I have not suffered in the exchange,
Master Droop?" said Bacon, reproachfully.
"In very truth, I were not worse found had I shrunken
one half within mine own doublet!"</p>

<p>After some further urging, Droop was induced to
descend the stairs, and soon the two men stood together
at the breach in the brick wall. They heard
the low whinnying of a horse close at hand.</p>

<p>"That is my steed," Bacon whispered. "You must
mount with instant speed and away with all haste
to the south, Master Droop."</p>

<p>"D'ye think I won't split these darned pants and
tight socks?" said Droop.</p>

<p>"Hush, friend, hush!" Bacon exclaimed. "The
bailiffs must not know we are here till they see you
mount and away. Nay&mdash;nay&mdash;fear not. The hose
and stockings will hold right securely, I warrant you."</p>

<p>"Well, so long!" said Droop, and the next moment
he was in the saddle. "G'lang there! Geet ap!"
he shouted, slapping the horse's neck with his bridle.</p>

<p>With a snort of surprise, the horse plunged forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
dashing across the moonlit field. A moment
later, Bacon saw two other horses leap forward in
pursuit from the dark cover of a neighboring grove.</p>

<p>"Good!" he exclaimed. "The lure hath taken!"</p>

<p>Then leaning over he rubbed his shins ruefully.</p>

<p>"How the night wind doth ascend within this barbarous
hose!" he grumbled.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">PH&OElig;BE AT THE PEACOCK INN</h3>


<p>While Copernicus Droop was acquiring fame and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
fortune as a photographer, Rebecca and Ph&oelig;be were
leading a quiet life in the city.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was perfectly happy. For her this was the
natural continuation of a visit which her father,
Isaac Burton, had very unwillingly permitted her
to pay to her dead mother's sister, Dame Goldsmith.
She was very fond of both her aunt and uncle, and
they petted and indulged her in every possible way.</p>

<p>Her chief source of happiness lay in the fact that
the Goldsmiths favored the suit of Sir Guy Fenton,
with whom she found herself deeply in love from the
moment when he had so opportunely arrived to rescue
the sisters from the rude horse-play of the Southwark
mob.</p>

<p>Poor Rebecca, on the other hand, found herself
in a most unpleasant predicament. She had shut
herself up in her room on the first day of her arrival
on discovering that her new hosts were ale drinkers,
and she had insisted upon perpetuating this imprisonment
when she had discovered that she would only
be accepted on the footing of a servant.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be, who remembered Rebecca both as her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
nineteenth-century sister and as her sixteenth-century
nurse and tiring-woman, thought this determination
the best compromise under the circumstances,
and explained to her aunt that Rebecca was subject
to recurring fits of delusion, and that it was necessary
at such times to humor her in all things.</p>

<p>On the very day of the visit of Francis Bacon to
the Panchronicon, the two sisters were sitting together
in their bed-room. Rebecca was at her knitting
by the window and Ph&oelig;be was rereading a letter
for the twentieth time, smiling now and then as she
read.</p>

<p>"'Pears to amuse ye some," said Rebecca, dryly,
looking into her sister's rosy face. "How'd it come?
I ain't seen the postman sence we've ben here.
Seems to me they ain't up to Keene here in London.
We hed a postman twice a day at Cousin Jane's
house."</p>

<p>"No, 'twas the flesher's lad brought it," said
Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>Rebecca grunted crossly.</p>

<p>"I wish the land sake ye'd say 'butcher' when ye
mean butcher, Ph&oelig;be," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, the butcher's boy, then, Miss Particular!"
said Ph&oelig;be, saucily.</p>

<p>Rebecca's face brightened.</p>

<p>"My! It does sound good to hear ye talk good
Yankee talk, Ph&oelig;be," she said. "Ye hevn't dropped
yer play-actin' lingo fer days and days."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, 'tis over hard to remember, sis!" said Ph&oelig;be,
carelessly. "But tell me, would it be unmaidenly,
think you, were I to grant Sir Guy a private meeting&mdash;without
the house?"</p>

<p>"Which means would I think ye was wrong to
spark with that high-falutin man out o' doors, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;say it so an thou wilt," said Ph&oelig;be, shyly.</p>

<p>"Why, ef you're goin' to keep comp'ny with him
'tall, I sh'd think ye'd go off with him by yerself.
Thet's the way sensible folks do&mdash;at least, I b'lieve
so," she added, blushing.</p>

<p>"Aunt Martha hath given me free permission to
see Sir Guy when I will," Ph&oelig;be continued. "But
she hath been full circumspect, and ever keepeth
within ear-shot."</p>

<p>"Humph!" snapped Rebecca. "Y'ain't got any
Aunt Martha's fur's I know, but ef ye mean that
fat, beer-drinkin' woman downstairs, why, 'tain't any
of her concern, an' I'd tell her so, too."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be twirled her letter between her fingers and
gazed pensively smiling out of the window. There
was a long pause, which was finally broken by Rebecca.</p>

<p>"What's the letter 'bout, anyway?" she said. "Is
it from the guy?"</p>

<p>"You mean Sir Guy," said Ph&oelig;be, in injured tones.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, sir or ma'am! Did he write it?"</p>

<p>"Why, truth to tell," said Ph&oelig;be, slipping the note
into her bosom, "'Tis but one of the letters I read
to thee from yon carved box, Rebecca."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"My sakes&mdash;that!" cried her sister. "How'd the
butcher's boy find it? You don't s'pose he stole it
out o' the Panchronicle, do ye?"</p>

<p>"Lord warrant us, sis, no! 'Twas writ this very
day. What o'clock is it?"</p>

<p>She ran to the window and looked down the street
toward the clock on the Royal Exchange.</p>

<p>"Three i' the afternoon," she muttered. "The
time is short. Shall I? Shall I not?"</p>

<p>"Talkin' o' letters," said Rebecca, suddenly, "I
wish'd you take one down to the Post-Office fer me,
Ph&oelig;be." She rose and went to a drawer in the dressing-table.
"Here's one 't I wrote to Cousin Jane in
Keene. I thought she might be worried about where
we'd got to, an' so I've written an' told her we're
in London."</p>

<p>"The Post-Office&mdash;" Ph&oelig;be began, laughingly.
Then she checked herself. Why undeceive her
sister? Here was the excuse she had been
seeking.</p>

<p>"Yes; an' I told her more'n that," Rebecca continued.
"I told her that jest's soon as the Panchronicle
hed got rested and got its breath, we'd set off
quick fer home&mdash;you an' me. Thet's so, ain't it,
Ph&oelig;be?" she concluded, with plaintive anxiety in her
voice.</p>

<p>"I'll take the letter right along," said Ph&oelig;be, with
sudden determination.</p>

<p>But Rebecca would not at once relax her hold on
the envelope.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's so, ain't it, dearie?" she insisted. "Won't
we make fer home as soon's we can?"</p>

<p>"Sis," said Ph&oelig;be, gravely, "an I be not deeply
in error, thou art right. Now give me the letter."</p>

<p>Rebecca relinquished the paper with a sigh of relief,
then looked up in surprise at Ph&oelig;be, who was
laughing aloud.</p>

<p>"Why, here's a five-cent stamp, as I live!" she
cried. "Where did it come from?"</p>

<p>"I hed it in my satchel," said Rebecca. "Ain't
that the right postage?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," said Ph&oelig;be, still laughing. "And now
for the Post-Office!"</p>

<p>She donned her coif and high-crowned hat with
silver braid, and leaned over Rebecca, who had seated
herself, to give her a good-by kiss.</p>

<p>"Great sakes!" exclaimed Rebecca, as she received
the unaccustomed greeting. "You do look fer all
the world like one o' the Salem witches in Peter
Parley's history, Ph&oelig;be."</p>

<p>With a light foot and a lighter heart for all its
beating, Ph&oelig;be ran down the street unperceived
from the house.</p>

<p>"Bishopsgate!" she sang under her breath. "The
missive named Bishopsgate. He'll meet me within
the grove outside the city wall."</p>

<p>Her feet seemed to know the way, which was not
over long, and she arrived without mishap at the
gate.</p>

<p>Here she was amazed to see two elderly men, evi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>dently
merchants, for they were dressed much like
her uncle the goldsmith, approach two gayly dressed
gentlemen and, stopping them on the street, proceed
to measure their swords and the width of their extravagant
ruffs with two yardsticks.</p>

<p>The four were so preoccupied with this ceremony
that she slipped past them without attracting the
disagreeable attention she might otherwise have received.</p>

<p>As she passed, the beruffled gentlemen were laughing,
and she heard one of them say:</p>

<p>"God buy you, friends, our ruffs and bilbos have
had careful measurement, I warrant you."</p>

<p>"Right careful, in sooth," said one of those with
the yardsticks. "They come within a hair's breadth
of her Majesty's prohibition."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be had scant time for wonder at this, for she
saw in a grove not a hundred yards beyond the gate
the trappings of a horse, and near by what seemed
a human figure, motionless, under a tree.</p>

<p>Making a circuit before entering the grove, she
came up behind the waiting figure, far enough within
the grove to be quite invisible from the highway.</p>

<p>She hesitated for some time ere she felt certain
that it was indeed Sir Guy who stood before her. He
was dressed in the extreme of fashion, and she fancied
that she could smell the perfumes he wore, as
they were borne on the soft breeze blowing toward
her.</p>

<p>His hair fell in curls on either side from beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
a splendid murrey French hat, the crown of which
was wound about with a gold cable, the brim being
heavy with gold twist and spangles. His flat soft
ruff, composed of many layers of lace, hung over a
thick blue satin doublet, slashed with rose-colored
taffeta and embroidered with pearls, the front of
which was brought to a point hanging over the front
of his hose in what was known as a peascod shape.
The tight French hose was also of blue satin, vertically
slashed with rose. His riding-boots were of
soft brown Spanish leather and his stockings of pearl-gray
silk. A pearl-gray mantle lined with rose-colored
taffeta was fastened at the neck, under the
ruff, and fell in elegant folds over his left arm, half
concealing the hand resting upon the richly jewelled
hilt of a sword whose scabbard was of black velvet.</p>

<p>"God ild us!" Ph&oelig;be exclaimed in low tones.
"What foppery have we here!"</p>

<p>Then, slipping behind a tree, she clapped her
hands.</p>

<p>Guy turned his head and gazed about in wonder,
for no one was visible. Ph&oelig;be puckered her lips
and whistled softly twice. Then, as her lover darted
forward in redoubled amazement, she stepped into
view, and smiled demurely upon him with hands
folded before her.</p>

<p>The young knight leaped forward, and, dropping
on one knee, carried her hand rapturously to his
lips.</p>

<p>"Now sink the orbed sun!" he exclaimed. "For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
behold a fairer cometh, whose love-darting eyes do
slay the night, rendering bright day eternate!"</p>

<p>Smiling roguishly down into his face, Ph&oelig;be shook
her head and replied:</p>

<p>"You are full of pretty phrases. Have you not
been acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned
them out of rings?"</p>

<p>For an instant the young man was disconcerted.
Then rising, he said:</p>

<p>"Nay, from the rings regardant of thine eyes I
learned my speech. What are golden rings to these?"</p>

<p>"Why, how much better is thy speech when it
ringeth true," said Ph&oelig;be. "Thy speech of greeting
was conned with much pains from the cold book of
prior calculation, and so I answered you from a poet's
play. I would you loved me!"</p>

<p>"Loved thee, oh, divine enchantress&mdash;too cruel-lovely
captress of my dole-breathing heart!"</p>

<p>"Tut&mdash;tut&mdash;tut!" she broke in, stamping her foot.
"Thou dost it badly, Sir Guy. A truce to Euphuistic
word-coining and phrase-shifting! Wilt show thy
love&mdash;in all sadness, say!"</p>

<p>"In any way&mdash;or sad or gay!"</p>

<p>"Then prithee, good knight, stand on thy head by
yonder tree."</p>

<p>The cavalier stepped back and gazed into his lady's
face as though he thought her mad.</p>

<p>"Stand&mdash;on&mdash;my&mdash;head!" he exclaimed, slowly.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be laughed merrily and clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"Good my persuasion!" she rippled. "See how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
thou art shaken into thyself, man. What! No
phrase of lackadaisical rapture! Why, I looked to
see thee invert thine incorporate satin in an airy
rhapsody&mdash;upheld and kept unruffled by some fantastical
twist of thine imagination. Oh, Fancy&mdash;Fancy!
Couldst not e'en sustain thy knight cap-à-pie!"
and she laughed the harder as she saw her
lover's face grow longer and longer.</p>

<p>"Why, mistress," he began, soberly, "these quips
and jests ill become a lover's tryst, methinks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As ill as paint and scent and ear-rings&mdash;as foppish
attire and fantastical phrases do become an honest
lover," said Ph&oelig;be, indignantly. "Dost think that
Mary Burton prizes these weary labyrinthine sentences&mdash;all
hay and wool, like the monstrous swelling
of trunk hose? Far better can I read in Master
Lilly's books. Thinkest thou I came hither to smell
civet? Nay&mdash;I love better the honest odor of cabbages
in mine aunt's kitchen! And all this finery&mdash;this
lace&mdash;this satin and this pearl embroidery&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In God His name!" the knight broke in, stamping
his foot. "Dost take me for a little half-weaned
knave, that I'll learn how to dress me of a woman?
An you like not my speech, mistress&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be cut him short, putting her hand on his
mouth.</p>

<p>Then she leaned her shoulder against a tree, and
looking up saucily into his face:</p>

<p>"Now, don't get mad!" she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mad&mdash;mad!" said Sir Guy, with a puzzled look.
"An this be madness, mistress, then is her Majesty's
whole court a madhouse."</p>

<p>"Well, young man," Ph&oelig;be replied, with her prim
New England manner, "if you want to marry me,
you'll have to come and live in a country where they
don't have queens, and you'll work in your shirt-sleeves
like an honest man. You might just's well
understand that first as last."</p>

<p>The knight moved back a step, with an injured
expression on his face.</p>

<p>"Nay, then," he said, "an thou mock me with uncouth
phrases, Mary, I'd best be going."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd better, Guy."</p>

<p>With a reproachful glance, but holding his head
proudly, the young man mounted his horse.</p>

<p>"He hath a noble air on horseback," Ph&oelig;be said
to herself, and she smiled.</p>

<p>The young man saw the smile and took courage.</p>

<p>He urged his horse forward to her side.</p>

<p>"Mary!" he exclaimed, tenderly.</p>

<p>"Fare thee well!" she replied, coolly, and turned
her back.</p>

<p>He bit his lip, clinched his hand, and without another
word, struck fiercely with his spurs. With a
snort of pain, the horse bounded forward, and Ph&oelig;be
found herself alone in the grove.</p>

<p>She gazed wistfully after the horseman and
clasped her hands in silence for a few moments.
Then, at thought of the letter she knew he was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to write&mdash;the letter she had often seen in the carved
box&mdash;she smiled again and, patting her skirts, stepped
forth merrily from the edge of the grove.</p>

<p>"After all, 'twill teach the silly lad better manners!"
she said.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she reached the highway again when
she heard a man's voice calling in hearty tones.</p>

<p>"Well met, Mistress Mary! I looked well to find
you near&mdash;for I take it 'twas Sir Guy passed me a
minute gone, spurring as 'twere a shame to see."</p>

<p>She looked up and saw a stout, middle-aged countryman
on horseback, holding a folded paper in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, 'tis thou, Gregory!" she said, coolly. "Mend
thy manners, man, and keep thy place."</p>

<p>The man grinned.</p>

<p>"For my place, Mistress Mary," he said, "I doubt
you know not where your place be."</p>

<p>She looked up with a frown of angry surprise.</p>

<p>"Up here behind me on young Bess," he grinned.
"See, here's your father's letter, mistress."</p>

<p>She took the paper with one hand while with the
other she patted the soft nose of the mare, who was
bending her head around to find her mistress.</p>

<p>"Good Bess&mdash;good old mare!" she said, gently,
gazing pensively at the letter.</p>

<p>How well she knew every wrinkle in that paper,
every curve in the clumsy superscription. Full well
she knew its contents, too; for had she not read this
very note to Copernicus Droop at the North Pole?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
However, partly that he might not be set to asking
questions, partly in curiosity, she unfolded the paper.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Poll</span>"&mdash;it began&mdash;"I'm starting behind the
grays for London on my way to be knighted by her
Majesty. I send this ahead by Gregory on Bess, she
being fast enow for my purpose, which is to get thee
out of the clutches of that ungodly aunt of thine. I
know her tricks, and I learn how she hath suffered
that damned milk-and-water popinjay to come courting
my Poll. So see you follow Gregory, mistress,
and without wait or parley come with him to the
Peacock Inn, where I lie to-night.</p>

<p>"The grays are in fine fettle, and thy black mare
grows too fat for want of exercise. Thy mother-in-law
commands thy instant return with Gregory, having
much business forward with preparing gowns
and fal lals against our presentation to her Majesty.&mdash;Thy
father, Isaac Burton, of Burton Hall.</p>

<p>"Thy mother thinks thou wilt make better speed
if I make thee to know that the players thou wottest
of are to stop at the Peacock Inn and will be giving
some sport there."</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>"The players!" she exclaimed, eagerly. "Be these
the Lord Chamberlain's men?" she asked. "Is there
not among them one Will Shakespeare, Gregory?
What play give they to-night?"</p>

<p>"All one to me, mistress," said Gregory, slowly
dismounting. "There be players at the Peacock, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the kitchen wench told me of them as I stopped there
for a pint; but be they the Lord Chamberlain's or
the Queen's, I cannot tell."</p>

<p>"Do they play at the Shoreditch Theatre or at the
inn, good Gregory?"</p>

<p>"I' faith I know not, mistress," he replied, bracing
his brawny right hand, palm up, at his knee.</p>

<p>Mechanically she put one foot into his palm and
sprang lightly upon the pillion behind the groom's
saddle.</p>

<p>As they turned and started at a jog trot northward,
she remembered her sister and her new-found aunt.</p>

<p>"Hold&mdash;hold, Gregory!" she cried. "What of Rebecca?
What of my aunt&mdash;my gowns?"</p>

<p>"I am to send an ostler from the Peacock for your
nurse and clothing, mistress," said Gregory. "My
orders was not to wait for aught, but bring you back
instant quickly wheresoever I found you." After a
pause he went on with a grin: "I doubt I came late,
hows'ever. Sir Guy hath had his say, I'm thinkin'!"
and he chuckled audibly.</p>

<p>"Now you mind your own business, Gregory!" said
Ph&oelig;be, sharply.</p>

<p>His face fell, and during the rest of their ride he
maintained a rigid silence.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The next morning found Ph&oelig;be sitting in her
room in the Peacock Inn, silently meditating in an
effort to establish order in the chaos of her mind.
Her hands lay passively in her lap, and between her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
fingers was an open sheet of paper whose crisp folds
showed it to be a letter.</p>

<p>Daily contact with the people, customs, dress, and
tongue of Elizabethan England was fast giving to
her memories of the nineteenth century the dim
seeming of a dream. As she came successively into
contact with each new-old acquaintance, he took his
place in her heart and mind full grown&mdash;completely
equipped with all the associations, loves, and antipathies
of long familiarity.</p>

<p>Gregory had brought her to the inn the night before,
and here she had received the boisterous welcome
of old Isaac Burton and the cooler greeting of
his dame, her step-mother. They took their places
in her heart, and she was not surprised to find it by
no means a high one. The old lady was overbearing
and far from loving toward Mistress Mary, as Ph&oelig;be
began to call herself. As for Isaac Burton, he
seemed quite subject to his wife's will, and Ph&oelig;be
found herself greatly estranged from him.</p>

<p>That first afternoon, however, had transported her
into a paradise the joys of which even Dame Burton
could not spoil.</p>

<p>Sitting in one of the exterior galleries overlooking
the courtyard of the inn, Ph&oelig;be had witnessed
a play given on a rough staging erected in the
open air.</p>

<p>The play was "The Merchant of Venice," and who
can tell the thrills that tingled through Ph&oelig;be's
frame as, with dry lips and a beating heart, she gazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
down upon Shylock. Behind that great false beard
was the face of England's mightiest poet. That wig
concealed the noble forehead so revered by high and
low in the home she had left behind.</p>

<p>She was Ph&oelig;be Wise, and only Ph&oelig;be, that afternoon,
enjoying to the full the privilege which chance
had thrown in her way. And now, the morning
after, she went over it all again in memory. She
rehearsed mentally every gesture and intonation of
the poet-actor, upon whom alone she had riveted her
attention throughout the play, following him in
thought, even when he was not on the stage.</p>

<p>Sitting there in her room, she smiled as she remembered
with what a start of surprise she had recognized
one among the groundlings in front of the
stage after the performance. It was Sir Guy, very
plainly dressed and gazing fixedly upon her. Doubtless
he had been there during the entire play, waiting
in vain for one sign of recognition. But Shylock had
held her spellbound, and even for her lover she had
been blind.</p>

<p>She felt a little touch of pity and compunction as
she remembered these things, and suddenly she lifted
to her lips the letter she was holding.</p>

<p>"Poor boy!" she murmured. Then, shaking her
head with a smile: "I wonder how his letter found
my room!" she said.</p>

<p>She rose, and, going to the window where the light
was stronger, flattened out the missive and read it
again:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear, dear Mary</span>&mdash;dear to me ever, e'en in
thy displeasure&mdash;have I fallen, then, so low in thy
sight! May I not be forgiven, sweet girl, or shall
I ever stand as I have this day, gazing upward in
vain for the dear glance my fault hath forfeited?</p>

<p>"In sober truth, dear heart, I hate myself for what
I was. What a sad mummery of lisping nothings
was my speech&mdash;and what a vanity was my attire!
Thou wast right, Mary, but oh! with what a ruthless
hand didst thou tear the veil from mine eyes! I
have seen my fault and will amend it, but oh! tell
me it was thy love and not thine anger that hath
prompted thee. And yet&mdash;why didst thou avert
thine eyes from me this even? Sweet&mdash;speak but
a word&mdash;write but a line&mdash;give some assurance, dear,
of pardon to him who is forever thine in the bonds
of love."</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>She folded the letter slowly and slipped it into
the bosom of her dress with a smile on her lips and
a far-away look in her eyes. She had known this
letter almost by heart before she received it. Had
it not been one of her New England collection?
Foreknowledge of it had emboldened her to rebuke
her lover when she met him by the Bishopsgate&mdash;and
yet&mdash;it had been a surprise and a sweet novelty
to her when she had found it on her dressing-table
the night before.</p>

<p>At length she turned slowly from the window and
said softly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guy's a good fellow, and I'm a lucky girl!"</p>

<p>There was a quick thumping of heavy feet on the
landing, and a moment later a young country girl
entered. It was Betty, one of the serving girls
whom Dame Burton had brought with her to London.</p>

<p>The lass dropped a clumsy courtesy, and said:</p>

<p>"Mistress bade me tell ye, Miss Mary, she would
fain have ye wait on her at once. She's in the inn
parlor." Then, after a pause: "Sure she hath matter
of moment for ye, I warrant, or she'd not look so
solemn satisfied."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was strongly tempted to decline this peremptory
invitation, but curiosity threw its weight
into the balance with complaisance, and with a dignified
lift of the chin she turned to the door.</p>

<p>"Show the way, Betty," she said.</p>

<p>Through several long corridors full of perplexing
turns and varied by many a little flight of steps, the
two young women made their way to the principal
parlor of the inn, where they found Mistress Burton
standing expectantly before a slow log fire.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be's worthy step-mother was a dame of middle
age, ruddy, black-haired, and stout. Her loud voice
and sudden movements betrayed a great fund of a
certain coarse energy, and, as her step-daughter now
entered the parlor, she was fanning her flushed face
with an open letter. Her expression was one of triumph
only half-concealed by ill-assumed commiseration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aha, lass!" she cried, as she caught sight of
Ph&oelig;be, "art here, then? Here are news in sooth&mdash;news
for&mdash;" She broke off and turned sharply upon
Betty, who stood by the door with mouth and ears
wide open.</p>

<p>"Leave the room, Betty!" she exclaimed. "Am I
to have every lazy jade in London prying and eavesdropping?
Trot&mdash;look alive!"</p>

<p>She strode toward the reluctant maid and, with a
good-natured push, hastened her exit. Then, closing
the door, she turned again toward Ph&oelig;be, who had
seated herself by the fire.</p>

<p>"Well, Polly," she resumed, "art still bent on thy
foppish lover, lass? Not mended since yesternight&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>A cool slow inclination of Ph&oelig;be's head was the
sole response.</p>

<p>"Out and alas!" the dame continued, tossing her
head with mingled pique and triumph. "'Tis a sad
day for thee and thine, then! This Sir Guy of thine
is as good as dead, girl! Thy popinjay is a traitor,
and his crimes have found him out!"</p>

<p>"A traitor!"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be stood erect with one hand on her heart.</p>

<p>Dame Burton repressed a smile and continued with
a slow shake of the head:</p>

<p>"Ay, girl; a traitor to her blessed Majesty the
Queen. His brother hath been discovered in traitorous
correspondence with the rebel O'Neill, and is on
his way to the Tower. Sir Guy's arrest hath been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
ordered, and the two brothers will lose their heads
together."</p>

<p>Very pale, Ph&oelig;be stood with hands tight clasped
before her.</p>

<p>"Where have you learned this, mother?" she said.</p>

<p>"Where but here!" the dame replied, shaking the
open sheet she held in her hand. "Thy Cousin Percy,
secretary to my good Lord Burleigh, he hath despatched
me this writing here, which good Master
Portman did read to me but now."</p>

<p>"Let me see it."</p>

<p>As Ph&oelig;be read the confirmation of her step-mother's
ill news, she tried to persuade herself that
it was but the fabrication of a jealous rival, for this
Percy was also an aspirant to her hand. But it
proved too circumstantial to admit of this construction,
and her first fears were confirmed.</p>

<p>"Ye see," said Dame Burton, as she received the
note again, "the provost guard is on the lad's track,
and with a warrant. I told thee thy wilful ways
would lead but to sorrow, Poll!"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be heard only the first sentence of this speech.
Her mind was possessed by one idea. She must warn
her lover. Mechanically she turned away, forgetful
of her companion, and passing through the door with
ever quicker steps, left her step-mother gazing after
her in speechless indignation.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be's movements were of necessity aimless at
first. Ignorant of Sir Guy's present abiding-place,
knowing of no one who could reach him, she wan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>dered
blindly forward, up one hall and down another
without a distinct immediate plan and mentally paralyzed
with dread.</p>

<p>The sick pain of fear&mdash;the longing to reach her
lover's side&mdash;these were the first disturbers of her
peace since her return into this strange yet familiar
life of the past. Now for the first time she was learning
how vital was the hold of a sincere and deep love.
The thought of harm to him&mdash;the fear of losing him&mdash;these
swept her being clear of all small coquetries
and maiden wiles, leaving room only for the strong,
true, sensitive love of an anxious woman. Over and
over again she whispered as she walked:</p>

<p>"Oh, Guy&mdash;Guy! Where shall I find you? What
shall I do!"</p>

<p>She had wandered long through the mazes of the
quaint old caravansary ere she found an exit. At
length she turned a sharp corner and found herself
at the top of a short flight of steps leading to a door
which opened upon the main outer court. At that
moment a new thought leaped into her mind and
she stopped abruptly, a rush of warm color mantling
on her cheeks.</p>

<p>Then, with a sigh of content, she sank down upon
the top step of the flight she had reached and gently
shook her head, smiling.</p>

<p>"Too much Mary Burton, Miss Ph&oelig;be!" she murmured.</p>

<p>She had recollected her precious box of letters.
Of these there was one which made it entirely clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
that Mary Burton and her lover were destined to
escape this peril; for it was written from him to her
after their flight from England. All her fears fell
away, and she was left free to taste the sweetness
of the new revelation without the bitterness in which
that revelation had had its source.</p>

<p>Very dear to Ph&oelig;be in after life was the memory
of the few moments which followed. With her mind
free from every apprehension, she leaned her shoulder
to the wall and turned her inward sight in
charmed contemplation upon the new treasure her
heart had found.</p>

<p>How small, how trifling appeared what she had
until then called her love! Her new-found depth
and height of tender devotion even frightened her
a little, and she forced a little laugh to avert the
tears.</p>

<p>Through the open door her eyes registered in
memory the casual movements without, while her
consciousness was occupied only with her soul's experience.
But soon this period of blissful inaction
was sharply terminated. Her still watching eyes
brought her a message so incongruous with her immediate
surroundings as to shake her out of her
waking dream. She became suddenly conscious of
a nineteenth-century intruder amid her almost medieval
surroundings.</p>

<p>All attention now, she sat quickly upright and
looked out again. Yes&mdash;there could be no mistake&mdash;Copernicus
Droop had passed the door and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
approaching the principal entrance of the inn on the
other side of the courtyard.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be ran quickly to the door and, protecting her
eyes with one hand from the flood of brilliant sunlight,
she called eagerly after the retreating figure.</p>

<p>"Mr. Droop&mdash;Mr. Droop!"</p>

<p>The figure turned just as Ph&oelig;be became conscious
of a small crowd of street loafers who had thronged
curiously about the courtyard entrance, staring at
the new-comer's outlandish garb. She saw the grinning
faces turn toward her at sound of her voice, and
she shrank back into the hallway to evade their gaze.</p>

<p>The man to whom she had called re-crossed the
courtyard with eager steps. There was something
strange in his gait and carriage, but the strong sunlight
behind him made his image indistinct, and besides,
Ph&oelig;be was accustomed to eccentricities on the
part of this somewhat disreputable acquaintance.</p>

<p>Her astonishment was therefore complete when,
on removing his hat as he entered the hallway, this
man in New England attire proved to be a complete
stranger.</p>

<p>Evidently the gentleman had suffered much from
the rudeness of his unwelcome followers, for his face
was flushed and his manner constrained and nervous.
Bowing slightly, he stood erect just within the door.</p>

<p>"Did you do me the honor of a summons, mistress?"
said he.</p>

<p>The look of amazement on Ph&oelig;be's face made
him bite his lips with increase of annoyance, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
saw in her emotion only renewed evidence of the
ridicule to which he had subjected himself.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I crave pardon!" Ph&oelig;be stammered. "I fear
I took you for another, sir."</p>

<p>"For one Copernicus Droop, and I mistake not!"</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" she faltered in amazement.</p>

<p>"I have met him&mdash;to my sorrow, mistress. 'Tis
the first time and the last, I vow, that Francis Bacon
hath dealt with mountebanks!"</p>

<p>"Francis Bacon!" cried Ph&oelig;be, delight and curiosity
now added to puzzled amazement. "Is it possible
that I see before me Sir Francis Bacon&mdash;or rather
Lord Verulam, I believe." She dropped a courtesy,
to which he returned a grave bow.</p>

<p>"Nay, good mistress," he replied. "Neither knight
nor lord am I, but only plain Francis Bacon, barrister,
and Secretary of the Star Chamber."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Ph&oelig;be exclaimed, "not yet, I see."</p>

<p>Then, as a look of grave inquiry settled over Bacon's
features, she continued eagerly: "Enough of
your additions, good Master Bacon. 'Twere better
I offered my congratulations, sir, than prated of these
lesser matters."</p>

<p>"Congratulations! Good lady, you speak in riddles!"</p>

<p>Smiling, she shook her head at him, looking meaningly
into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, think not <i>all</i> are ignorant of what you have
so ably hidden, Master Bacon," she said. "Can it
be that the author of that wondrous play I saw here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
given but yesternight can be content to hide his name
behind that of a too greatly favored player?"</p>

<p>"Play, mistress!" Bacon exclaimed. "Why, here
be more soothsaying manners from a fairer speaker&mdash;but
still as dark as the uncouth ravings of that
fellow&mdash;that&mdash;that Droop."</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;nay!" Ph&oelig;be insisted. "You need fear no
tattling, sir. I will keep your secret&mdash;though in
very truth, were I in your worship's place, 'twould
go hard but the whole world should know my
glory!"</p>

<p>"Secret&mdash;glory!" Bacon exclaimed. "In all conscience,
mistress, I beg you will make more clear
the matter in question. Of what play speak you?
Wherein doth it concern Francis Bacon?"</p>

<p>"To speak plainly, then, sir, I saw your play of
the vengeful Jew and good Master Antonio. What!
Have I struck home!"</p>

<p>She leaned against the wall with her hands behind
her and looked up at him triumphantly. To her confusion,
no answering gleam illumined the young
man's darkling eyes.</p>

<p>"Struck home!" he exclaimed, shaking his head
querulously. "Perhaps&mdash;but where? Do you perchance
make a mock of me, Mistress&mdash;Mistress&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>She replied to the inquiry in his manner and tone
with disappointment in her voice:</p>

<p>"Mistress Mary Burton, sir, at your service."</p>

<p>Bacon started back a step and a new and eager
light leaped into his eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"The daughter of Isaac Burton?" he cried, "soon
to be Sir Isaac?"</p>

<p>"The same, sir. Do you know my father?"</p>

<p>"Ay, indeed. 'Twas to seek him I came hither."</p>

<p>Then, starting forward, Bacon poured forth in
eager accents a full account of his meeting with
Droop in the deserted grove&mdash;of how they two had
conspired to evade the bailiffs, and of his reasons for
borrowing Droop's clothing.</p>

<p>"Conceive, then, my plight, dear lady," he concluded,
"when, on reaching London, I found that the
few coins which remained to me had been left in the
clothes which I gave to this Droop, and I have come
hither to implore the temporary aid of your good
father."</p>

<p>"But he hath gone into London, Master Bacon,"
said Ph&oelig;be. "It is most like he will not return ere
to-morrow even."</p>

<p>Droop's hat dropped from Bacon's relaxed grasp
and he seemed to wilt in his speechless despair.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be's sympathy was awakened at once, but her
anxiety to know more of the all-important question
of authorship was perhaps the keenest of her emotions.</p>

<p>"Why," she exclaimed, "'tis a little matter that
needs not my father, methinks. If ten pounds will
serve you, I should deem it an honor to provide
them."</p>

<p>Revived by hope, he drew himself up briskly as
he replied:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, 'twill do marvellous well, Mistress Mary&mdash;marvellous
well&mdash;nor shall repayment be delayed,
upon my honor!"</p>

<p>"Nay, call it a fee," she replied, "and give me, I
beg of you, a legal opinion in return."</p>

<p>Bacon stooped to pick up the hat, from which he
brushed the dust with his hand as he replied, with
dubious slowness, looking down:</p>

<p>"Why, in sooth, mistress, I am used to gain a
greater honorarium. As a barrister of repute, mine
opinions in writing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, then, I fear my means are too small!" Ph&oelig;be
broke in, with a smile. "'Tis a pity, too, for the
matter is simple, I verily believe."</p>

<p>Bacon saw that he must retract or lose all, and he
went on with some haste:</p>

<p>"Perchance 'tis not an opinion in writing that is
required," he said.</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;nay; your spoken word will suffice, Master
Bacon."</p>

<p>"In that case, then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She drew ten gold pieces from her purse and
dropped them into his extended palm. Then, seating
herself upon a bench against the wall hard by,
she said:</p>

<p>"The case is this: If a certain merchant borrow
a large sum from a Jew in expectation of the speedy
arrival of a certain argosy of great treasure, and if
the merchant give his bond for the sum, the penalty
of the bond being one pound of flesh from the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of the merchant, and if then the argosies founder
and the bond be forfeit, may the Jew recover the
pound of flesh and cut it from the body of the merchant?"</p>

<p>As she concluded, Ph&oelig;be leaned forward and
watched her companion's face earnestly, hoping that
he would betray his hidden interest in this Shakespearian
problem by some look or sign.</p>

<p>The face into which she gazed was grave and judicial
and the reply was a ready one.</p>

<p>"Assuredly not! Such a bond were contrary to
public policy and void <i>ab initio</i>. The case is not one
for hesitancy; 'tis clear and certain. No court in
Christendom would for a moment lend audience to
the Jew. Why, to uphold the bond were to license
murder. True, the victim hath to this consented;
but 'tis doctrine full well proven and determined,
that no man can give valid consent to his own murder.
Were this otherwise, suicide were clearly lawful."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Ph&oelig;be exclaimed, as this new view of the
subject was presented to her. "Then the Duke of
Venice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off and hurried into new questioning.</p>

<p>"Another opinion hath been given me," she said.
"'Twas urged that the Jew could have his pound of
flesh, for so said the bond, but that he might shed
no blood in the cutting, blood not being mentioned
in the bond, and that his goods were forfeit
did he cut more or less than a pound, by so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
much as the weight of a hair. Think you this be
law?"</p>

<p>Still could she see no shadow in Bacon's face betraying
consciousness that there was more in her
words than met the ear.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no!" he replied, somewhat contemptuously.
"If that A make promise of a chose tangible to B
and the promise fall due, B may have not only that
which was promised, but all such matters and things
accessory as must, by the very nature of the agreed
transfer, be attached to the thing promised. As, if
I sell a calf, I may not object to his removal because,
forsooth, some portion of earth from my land clingeth
to his hoofs. So blood is included in the word
'flesh' where 'twere impossible to deliver the flesh
without some blood. As for that quibble of nor
more nor less, why, 'tis the debtor's place to deliver
his promise. If he himself cut off too much, he injures
himself, if too little he hath not made good
his covenant."</p>

<p>Complete conviction seemed to spring upon
Ph&oelig;be, as though it had been something visible to
startle her. It shook off her old English self for a
moment, and she leaped to her feet, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Well, there now! That settles that! I guess if
anybody wrote Shakespeare, it wasn't Bacon!"</p>

<p>The astonishment&mdash;almost alarm&mdash;in her companion's
face filled her with amusement, and her
happy laugh rang through the echoing halls.</p>

<p>"Many, many gracious thanks, good Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Bacon!" she exclaimed. "Right well have you earned
your honorarium. And now, ere you depart, may
I make bold to urge one last request?"</p>

<p>With a bow the young man expressed his acquiescence.</p>

<p>"If I mistake not, you will return forthwith to
Master Droop, to the end that you may regain your
proper garb, will you not?"</p>

<p>"That is my intention."</p>

<p>"Then I pray you, good Master Bacon, deliver
this message to Master Droop from one Ph&oelig;be Wise,
an acquaintance of his whom I know well. Tell him
he must have all in readiness for flight and must not
leave his abode until she come. May I rely on your
faithful repetition of this to him?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly. I shall forget no word of the message
wherewith I am so honored."</p>

<p>"Tell him that it is a matter of life and death, sir&mdash;of
life and death!"</p>

<p>She held out her hand. Bacon pressed his lips to
the dainty fingers and then, jamming the hard Derby
hat as far down over his long locks as possible, he
stepped forth once more into the courtyard.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">HOW THE QUEEN READ HER NEWSPAPER</h3>


<p>For Rebecca, left alone in the goldsmiths' city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
house, the past night and day had been a period of
perplexity. She had been saved from any serious
anxiety by the arrival of a messenger soon after
Ph&oelig;be's departure, who had brought her word that
her "mistress" was safe in the Peacock Inn, and had
left a verbal message commanding her to come with
him at once to rejoin her.</p>

<p>This command she naturally refused to comply
with, and sent word to the much-puzzled man-servant
that she wasn't to be "bossed around" by her younger
sister, and that if Ph&oelig;be wanted to see her she
knew where to find her. This message was delivered
to old Mistress Burton, who refrained from
repeating it to her step-daughter. For her own
ends, she thought it best to keep Mistress Mary
from her nurse, whose influence seemed invariably
opposed to her own.</p>

<p>Left thus alone, Rebecca had had a hitherto unequalled
opportunity for reflection, and the result
of her deliberations was most practical. Whatever
might be said of the inhabitants of London in general,
it was clear to her mind that poor Ph&oelig;be was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
mentally unbalanced.</p>

<p>The only remedy was to lure her into the Panchronicon,
and regain the distant home they ought
never to have left.</p>

<p>The first step to be taken was therefore to rejoin
Copernicus and see that all was in readiness. It was
her intention then to seek her sister and, by humoring
her delusion and exercising an appropriately benevolent
cunning, to induce her to enter the conveyance
which had brought them both into this disastrous
complication. The latter part of this programme
was not definitely formed in her mind, and
when she sought to give it shape she found herself
appalled both by its difficulties and by the probable
twists that her conscience would have to undergo in
putting her plan into practice.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" she exclaimed at length. "I'll cross
that bridge when I come to it. The fust thing is
to find Copernicus Droop."</p>

<p>It was at about eleven o'clock in the morning of
the day after Ph&oelig;be's departure that Rebecca came
to this audible conclusion, and she arose at once to
don her jacket and bonnet. This accomplished, she
gathered up her precious satchel and umbrella and
approached her bed-room window to observe the
weather.</p>

<p>She had scarcely fixed her eyes upon the muddy
streets below her when she uttered a cry of amazement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good gracious alive! Ef there ain't Copernicus
right this minute!"</p>

<p>Out through the inner hall and down the stairs
she hurried with short, shuffling steps, impatient of
the clinging rushes on the floor. Speechless she ran
past good Mistress Goldsmith, who called after her
in vain. The only reply was the slam of the front
door.</p>

<p>Once in the street, Rebecca glanced sharply up and
down. The man she sought was not in sight, but
she shrewdly counted upon his having turned into
Leadenhall Street, toward which she had seen him
walking. Thither she hurried, and to her infinite
gratification she saw, about a hundred yards ahead,
the unmistakable trousers, coat, and Derby hat so
familiar on the person of Copernicus Droop.</p>

<p>"Hey!" she cried. "Hey, there, Mister Droop!
Copernicus Droop!"</p>

<p>She ended with a shrill, far-carrying, long-drawn
call that sounded much like a "whoop." Evidently
he heard her, for he started, looked over his shoulder,
and then set off with redoubled speed, as though
anxious to avoid her.</p>

<p>She stopped short for a moment, paralyzed with
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Well!" she exclaimed. "If I ever! I suppose
it's a case of 'the wicked flee,' but he can't get away
from me as easy's that."</p>

<p>And then began a race the like of which was never
seen before. In advance, Francis Bacon scurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
forward as fast as he dared without running, dreading
the added publicity his rapid progress was sure
to bring upon him, yet dreading even more to be
overtaken by this amazing female apparition, in
whose accents and intonation he recognized another
of the Droop species.</p>

<p>Behind Bacon came Rebecca, conspicuous enough
in her prim New England gown and bonneted head,
but doubly remarkable as she skipped from stone to
stone to avoid the mud and filth of the unpaved
streets, and swinging in one hand her little black
satchel and in the other her faithful umbrella.</p>

<p>From time to time she called aloud: "Hey, stop
there! Copernicus Droop! Stop, I say! It's only
Rebecca Wise!"</p>

<p>The race would have been a short one, indeed,
had she not found it impossible to ignore the puddles,
rubbish heaps, and other obstacles which half-filled
the streets and obstructed her path at every turn.
Bacon, who was accustomed to these conditions
and had no impeding skirts to check him, managed,
therefore, to hold his own without actually running.</p>

<p>These two were not long left to themselves. Such
a progress could not take place in the heart of England's
capital without forming in its train an ever-growing
suite of the idle and curious. Ere long a
rabble of street-walkers, beggars, pick-pockets, and
loafers were stamping behind Rebecca, repeating her
shrill appeals with coarse variations, and assailing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
with jokes which, fortunately for her, were worded
in terms which her New England ears could not comprehend.</p>

<p>In this order the two strangely clad beings hurried
down toward the Thames; he in the hope of
finding a waterman who should carry him beyond
the reach of his dreaded persecutors; she counting
upon the river, which she knew to lie somewhere
ahead, to check the supposed Copernicus in his obstinate
flight.</p>

<p>To the right they turned, through St. Clement's
Lane into Crooked Lane, and the ever-growing mob
clattered noisily after them, shouting and laughing
a gleeful chorus to her occasional solo.</p>

<p>Leaving Eastcheap and its grimy tenements, they
emerged from New Fish Street and saw the gleam
of the river ahead of them.</p>

<p>At this moment one of the following crowd, more
enterprising than his fellows, ran close up behind
Rebecca and, clutching the edge of her jacket, sought
to restrain her.</p>

<p>"Toll, lass, toll!" he shouted. "Who gave thee
leave to run races in London streets?"</p>

<p>Rebecca became suddenly fully conscious for the
first time of the sensation she had created. Stopping
short, she swung herself free and looked her
bold assailant fairly in the face.</p>

<p>"Well, young feller," she said, with icy dignity,
"what can I do fer you?"</p>

<p>The loafer fell back as she turned, and when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
had spoken, he turned in mock alarm and fled, crying
as he ran:</p>

<p>"Save us&mdash;save us! Ugly and old as a witch, I
trow!"</p>

<p>Those in the background caught his final words
and set up a new cry which boded Rebecca no good.</p>

<p>"A witch&mdash;a witch! Seize her! Stone her!"</p>

<p>As they now hung back momentarily in a new
dread, self-created in their superstitious minds, Rebecca
turned again to the chase, but was sorely put
out to find that her pause had given the supposed
Droop the advantage of a considerable gain. He
was now not far from the river side. Hoping he
could go no farther, she set off once more in pursuit,
observing silence in order to save her breath.</p>

<p>She would apparently have need of it to save herself,
for the stragglers in her wake were now impelled
by a more dangerous motive than mere curiosity or
mischief. The cry of "Witch" had awakened cruel
depths in their breasts, and they pressed forward in
close ranks with less noise and greater menace than
before.</p>

<p>Two or three rough fellows paused to kick stones
loose from the clay of the streets, and in a few moments
the all-unconscious Rebecca would have found
herself in a really terrible predicament but for an
accident seemingly without bearing upon her circumstances.</p>

<p>Without warning, someone in the upper story of
one of the houses near by threw from a window a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
pail of dirty water, which fell with a startling splash
a few feet in front of Rebecca.</p>

<p>She stopped in alarm and looked up severely.</p>

<p>"I declare to goodness! I b'lieve the folks in this
town are all plumb crazy! Sech doin's! The idea
of throwin' slops out onto the road! Why, the Kanucks
wouldn't do that in New Hampshire!"</p>

<p>Slipping her bag onto her left wrist, she loosened
the band of her umbrella and shook the ribs free.</p>

<p>"Lucky I brought my umbrella!" she exclaimed.
"I guess it'll be safer fer me to h'ist this, ef things is
goin' to come out o' windows!"</p>

<p>All unknown to her, two or three of the rabble
behind her were in the act of poising themselves with
great stones in their hands, and their muscles were
stiffening for a cast when, just in the nick of time,
the obstinate snap yielded, and with a jerk the umbrella
spread itself.</p>

<p>Turning the wide-spread gloria skyward, Rebecca
hurried forward once more, still bent upon overtaking
Copernicus Droop.</p>

<p>That simple act saved her.</p>

<p>A mere inactive witch was one thing&mdash;a thing
scarce distinguishable from any other old woman.
But this transformation of a black wand into a wide-spreading
tent was so obviously the result of magic,
that it was self-evident they had to do with a witch
in full defensive and offensive state.</p>

<p>Stones fell from deadened hands and the threatening
growls and cries were lost in a unanimous gasp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
of alarm. A moment's pause and then&mdash;utter rout.
There was a mad stampede and in a trice the street
was empty. Rebecca was alone under that inoffensive
guardian umbrella.</p>

<p>To her grief, she found no one on the river's brim.
He whom she sought was half-way across, his conveyance
the only wherry in sight, apparently. Having
passed beyond the houses, Rebecca now folded
her umbrella and looked carefully about her. To
her great relief, she caught sight of a man's figure
recumbent on a stone bench near at hand. A pair
of oars lay by him and betrayed his vocation.</p>

<p>She stepped promptly to his side and prodded him
with her umbrella.</p>

<p>"Here, mister!" she cried. "Wake up, please.
What do you charge for ferryin' folks across the
river?"</p>

<p>The waterman sat up, rubbed his eyes and yawned.
Then, without looking at his fare, he led the way
to his boat without reply. He was chary of words,
and after all, did not all the world know what to
pay for conveyance to Southwark?</p>

<p>Rebecca gazed after him for a moment and then,
shaking her head pityingly, she murmured:</p>

<p>"Tut&mdash;tut! Deef an' dumb, poor man! Dear,
dear!"</p>

<p>To hesitate was to lose all hope of overtaking the
obstinate Copernicus. So, first pointing vigorously
after the retreating boat with closed umbrella, and
with many winks and nods which she supposed sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>plied
full meaning to her gestures, she stepped into
the wherry, and the two at once glided out on the
placid bosom of the Thames.</p>

<p>Far different was the spectacle that greeted her
then from that which may now be witnessed near
London Bridge. In those days that bridge was alone
visible, not far to the East, and the tide that moves
now so darkly between stone embankments beneath
a myriad of grimy steamers, then flowed brightly
between low banks and wooden wharves, bearing a
gliding fleet of sailing-vessels. To the south were
the fields and woods of the open country, save where
loomed the low frame houses and the green-stained
wharves of Southwark village. Behind Rebecca was
a vast huddle of frame buildings, none higher than
three stories, sharp of gable overhanging narrow
streets, while here a tower and there a steeple stood
sentinel over the common herd. To the east the
four great stone cylinders of the Tower, frowning
over the moving world at their feet, loomed grimly
then as now.</p>

<p>Rebecca had fixed her eyes at first with a fascinated
stare on this mighty mass of building, penetrated
by a chill of fear, although ignorant of its
tragic significance. Turning after a minute or two
from contemplation of that gloomy monument of
tyrannical power, she gazed eagerly forward again,
bent upon keeping sight of the man she was
pursuing.</p>

<p>He and his boat had disappeared, but her disap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>pointment
was at once lost in admiring stupefaction
as she gazed upon a magnificent craft bearing across
the bows of her boat and coming from the direction
of Westminster.</p>

<p>The hull, painted white, was ornamented with a
bold arabesque of gilding which seemed to flow naturally
in graceful lines from the garment of a golden
image of Victory mounted high on the towering
prow.</p>

<p>From the deck at the front and back rose two large
cabins whose sides were all of brilliant glass set between
narrow panels on which were paintings, which
Rebecca could not clearly distinguish from where
she was sitting.</p>

<p>At the waist, between and below the cabins, ten
oars protruded from each side of the barge, flashing
rhythmically as they swept forward together,
seeming to sprinkle drops of sunlight into the
river.</p>

<p>The splendor of this apparition, contrasting as it
did with the small and somewhat dingy craft otherwise
visible above the bridge, gave a new direction
to Rebecca's thoughts and forced from her an almost
involuntary exclamation.</p>

<p>"For the lands sakes!" she murmured. "Whoever
in the world carries on in sech style's that!"</p>

<p>The waterman looked over his shoulder, and no
sooner caught sight of the glittering barge than, with
a powerful push of his oars, he backed water and
brought his little boat to a stand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Queen!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Rebecca glanced at the boatman with slightly
raised brows.</p>

<p>"Thought you was deef an' dumb," she said. Then,
turning once more to the still approaching barge, she
continued: "An' so thet's Queen Victoria's ship, is
it?"</p>

<p>"Victoria!" growled the waterman. "Ye seem as
odd in speech as in dress, mistress. Who gave ye
license to miscall our glorious sovereign?"</p>

<p>Rebecca's brows were knit in a thoughtful frown
and she scarce knew what her companion said. The
approach of the Queen suggested a new plan of action.
She had heard of queens as all-powerful rulers,
women whose commands would be obeyed at once
and without question, in small and personal things
as in matters of greater moment. Of Queen Victoria,
too, some accounts had reached her, and all
had been in confirmation of that ruler's justice and
goodness of heart.</p>

<p>Rebecca's new plan was therefore to appeal at once
to this benign sovereign for aid, entreat her to command
the Burtons to release Ph&oelig;be and to order
Copernicus Droop to carry both sisters back to their
New England home. This course recommended itself
strongly to the strictly honest Rebecca, because
it eliminated at once all necessity for "humoring"
Ph&oelig;be's madness, with its implied subterfuges and
equivocations. The moment was propitious for making
an attempt which could at least do no harm, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
thought. She determined to carry out the plan
which had occurred to her.</p>

<p>Standing up in the boat: "What's the Queen's last
name?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Be seated, woman!" growled the waterman, who
was growing uneasy at sight of the increasing eccentricity
of his fare. "The Queen's name is Elizabeth,
as well ye know," he concluded, more gently. He
hoped to soothe the woman's frenzy by concessions.</p>

<p>"Now, mister," said Rebecca, severely, "don't you
be sassy to me, fer I won't stand it. Of course, I
don't want her first name&mdash;she ain't hired help.
What's the Queen's family name&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>The waterman, now convinced that his fare was a
lunatic, could think of naught better than to use
soothing tones and to reply promptly, however absurd
her questions. "I' faith," he said, in a mild
voice, "I' faith, mistress, her Gracious Majesty is of
the line of Tudor. Methought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he broke off in horror.</p>

<p>Waving her umbrella high above her head, Rebecca,
still standing upright in the boat, was calling
at the top of her voice:</p>

<p>"Hallo there! Mrs. Tudor! Stop the ship, will
ye! I want to speak to Mrs. Tudor a minute!"</p>

<p>All nature seemed to shiver and shrink in silence
at this enormous breach of etiquette&mdash;to use a mild
term. Involuntarily the ten pairs of oars in the
royal barge hung in mid-air, paralyzed by that sudden
outrage. The great, glittering structure, im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>pelled
by momentum, glided forward directly under
the bows of Rebecca's boat and not a hundred yards
away.</p>

<p>Again Rebecca's cry was borne shrill and clear
across the water.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Hallo there! Ain't Mrs. Tudor on the
ship? I want to speak to her!" Then, turning to
the stupefied and trembling waterman:</p>

<p>"Why don't you row, you? What's the matter,
anyway? Don't ye see they've stopped to wait fer
us?"</p>

<p>Someone spoke within the after cabin. The command
was repeated in gruff tones by a man's voice,
and the ten pairs of oars fell as one into the water
and were held rigid to check the progress of the
barge.</p>

<p>"Wherry, ahoy!" a hail came from the deck.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!" the waterman cried.</p>

<p>"Come alongside!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>Pale and weak with dread, the boatman pulled as
well as he could toward the splendid vessel ahead,
while Rebecca resumed her seat, quite satisfied that
all was as it should be.</p>

<p>A few strokes of the oars brought them to the
barge's side, and Rebecca's waterman threw a rope
to one of the crew.</p>

<p>A young man in uniform glowered down upon
them, and to him the waterman turned, pulling off
his cap and speaking with the utmost humility.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"The jade is moon-struck, your worship!" he exclaimed,
eagerly. "I would not for a thousand
pound&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Moon-struck!" snapped the lieutenant. "Who
gave thee commission to ferry madmen, fellow?"</p>

<p>The poor waterman, at his wits' end, was about
to reply when Rebecca interposed.</p>

<p>"Young man," she said, standing up, "I'll thank
you to 'tend to business. Is Mrs. Victoria Tudor at
home?"</p>

<p>At this moment a young gentleman, magnificently
apparelled, stepped forth from the after cabin and
approached the man in uniform.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," he said, "her Majesty commands
that the woman be brought before her in person.
As for you," he continued, turning to the waterman,
"return whence you came, and choose your fares better
henceforth."</p>

<p>Two of the barge's crew extended each a hand
to Rebecca.</p>

<p>"Bend onto that, Poll!" said one, grinning.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" exclaimed Rebecca. "I never
see sech impident help in all my born days! Ain't
ye got any steps for a body to climb?"</p>

<p>A second gorgeously dressed attendant backed
hastily out of the cabin.</p>

<p>"Look alive!" he said, peremptorily. "Her Majesty
waxes impatient. Where is the woman?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!" replied the sailors. "Here she be!"</p>

<p>They leaned far forward and, grasping the aston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>ished
Rebecca each by a shoulder, lifted her quickly
over the rail.</p>

<p>The first gentleman messenger beckoned to her
and started toward the cabin.</p>

<p>"Follow me!" he said, curtly.</p>

<p>Rebecca straightened her skirt and bonnet, shook
her umbrella, and turned quietly to the rail, fumbling
with the catch of her bag.</p>

<p>"I pity yer manners, young man!" she said, coldly.
Then, with some dismay:</p>

<p>"Here you, mister, don't ye want yer money?"</p>

<p>But the waterman, only too glad to escape at all
from being involved in her fate, was pulling back to
the northern shore as fast as his boat would go.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," said Rebecca, simply. "Saves me
a dime, I guess."</p>

<p>Turning then to the impatient gentleman waiting
at the door:</p>

<p>"Guess you're one o' the family, ain't ye? Is your
ma in, young man?"</p>

<p>Fortunately her full meaning was not comprehended,
and the person addressed contented himself
with drawing aside the heavy curtain of cloth of gold
and motioning to Rebecca to precede him.</p>

<p>She nodded graciously and passed into the cabin.</p>

<p>"That's better," she said, with an ingratiating
smile. "Good manners never did a mite o' harm,
did they?"</p>

<p>Before following her, the messenger turned again
to the young lieutenant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Give way!" he said.</p>

<p>At once the sweeps fell together, and the great
barge resumed its course down the river.</p>

<p>As Rebecca entered the glass and gold enclosure,
she was at first quite dazzled by the crowd of gorgeously
arrayed courtiers who stood in two compact
groups on either side of her. Young and old alike, all
these men of the sword and cloak seemed vying one
with another for precedence in magnificence and
foppery. The rarest silks of every hue peeped forth
through slashed velvets and satins whose rustling
masses bedecked men of every age and figure. Painted
faces and ringed ears everywhere topped snowy
ruffles deep and wide, while in every hand,
scented gloves, fans, or like toys amused the idle
fingers.</p>

<p>In the background Rebecca was only vaguely conscious
of a group of ladies in dresses of comparatively
sober pattern and color; but seated upon a luxurious
cushioned bench just in front of the others, one of
her sex struck Rebecca at once as the very centre
and climax of the magnificence that surrounded her.</p>

<p>Here sat Elizabeth, the vain, proud, tempestuous
daughter of "bluff King Hal." Already an old
woman, she yet affected the dress and carriage of
young maidenhood, possessing unimpaired the vanity
of a youthful beauty, and, despite her growing
ugliness, commanding the gallant attentions that
gratified and supported that vanity.</p>

<p>Her face, somewhat long and thin, was carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
painted, but not so successfully as to hide the many
wrinkles traced there by her sixty-five years. Her
few blackened teeth and her false red hair seemed
to be mocked by the transcendent lustre of the rich
pearl pendants in her ears. Her thin lips, hooked
nose, and small black eyes betokened suppressed anger
as she glared upon her admiring visitor; but, far
from being alarmed by the Queen's expression, Rebecca
was only divided between her admiration of
her magnificent apparel and blushing uneasiness at
sight of the frankly uncovered bosom which Elizabeth
exhibited by right of her spinsterhood. Rebecca
remembered ever afterward how she wished
that "all those men" would sink through the floor
of the cabin.</p>

<p>The Queen was at first both angry at the unheard-of
language Rebecca had used, and curious to see
what manner of woman dared so to express herself.
But now that she set eyes upon the outlandish garb
of her prisoner, her curiosity grew at the expense of
her wrath, and she sat silent for some time while
her little black eyes sought to explore the inmost
depths of Rebecca's mind.</p>

<p>Rebecca, for her part, was quite unconscious of
having infringed any of the rules of courtly etiquette,
and, without expressing her belief in her
complete social equality with the Queen or anyone
else present, was so entirely convinced of this equality
that she would have deemed a statement of it
ridiculously superfluous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>For a few moments she stood in the middle of the
open space immediately before the Queen, partly
dazed and bewildered into silence, partly expectant
of some remark from her hostess.</p>

<p>At length, observing the grimly rigid aspect of
the silent Queen, Rebecca straightened herself primly
and remarked, with her most formal air: "I s'pose
you are the Queen, ma'am. You seem to be havin'
a little party jest now. I hope I'm not intruding
but to tell ye the truth, Mrs. Tudor, I've got into
a pretty pickle and I want to ask a little favor of
you."</p>

<p>She looked about to right and left as though in
search of something.</p>

<p>"Don't seem to be any chairs around, only yours,"
she continued. Then, with a quick gesture of the
hand: "No, don't get up. Set right still now. One
o' your friends here can get me a chair, I guess," and
she looked very meaningly into the face of a foppish
young courtier who stood near her, twisting his thin
yellow beard.</p>

<p>At this moment the rising wonder of the Queen
reached a climax, and she burst into speech with characteristic
emphasis.</p>

<p>"What the good jere!" she cried. "Hath some
far planet sent us a messenger. The dame is loyal
in all her fantasy. Say, my Lord of Nottingham,
hath the woman a frenzy, think you?"</p>

<p>The gentleman addressed stood near the Queen
and was conspicuous for his noble air. His prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
gray eyes under rounded brows lighted up a long,
oval face surmounted by a high, bald forehead. The
long nose was aquiline, and the generous, full-lipped
mouth was only half hidden by a neatly trimmed
full blond beard. Rebecca noticed his dress particularly
as he stepped forward at the Queen's summons,
and marvelled at the two doublets and heavy cape
coat over which hung a massive gold chain supporting
the brilliant star of some order. She wondered
how he could breathe with that stiff ruff close up
under his chin and inclined downward from back to
front.</p>

<p>Dropping on one knee, Nottingham began his reply
to the Queen's inquiry, though ere he finished
his sentence he rose to his feet again at a gracious
sign from his royal mistress.</p>

<p>"May it please your Majesty," he said, "I would
humbly crave leave to remove the prisoner from a
presence she hath nor wit nor will to reverence. Judicial
inquiry, in form appointed, may better determine
than my poor judgment whether she be mad
or bewitched."</p>

<p>This solemn questioning of her sanity produced
in Rebecca's mind a teasing compound of wrath and
uneasiness. These people seemed to find something
fundamentally irregular in her behavior. What
could it be? The situation was intolerable, and she
set to work in her straightforward, energetic way to
bring it to an end.</p>

<p>Stepping briskly up to the astonished Earl of Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>tingham,
she planted herself firmly before him, turning
her back upon Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"Now look a-here, Mr. Nottingham," she said, severely,
"I'd like to know what in the world you see
that's queer about me or my ways. What's the matter,
anyway? I came here to make a quiet call on
that lady," here she pointed at the Queen with her
umbrella, "and instead of anybody bringin' a chair,
or sayin' 'How d'ye do,' the whole raft of ye hev
done nothin' but stare or call me loony. I s'pose
you're mad because I've interrupted your party, but
didn't that man there invite me in? Ef you're all
so dreadful particler, I'll jest get out o' here till Mrs.
Tudor can see me private. I'll set outside, ef I can
find a chair."</p>

<p>With an air of offended dignity she stalked toward
the door, but turned ere she had gone ten steps and
continued, addressing the assembled company collectively:</p>

<p>"As fer bein' loony, I can tell you this. Ef you
was where I come from in America, they'd say every
blessed one of ye was crazy as a hen with her head
off."</p>

<p>"America!" exclaimed the Queen, as a new
thought struck her. "America! Tell me, dame,
come you from the New World?"</p>

<p>"That's what it's sometimes called in the geographies,"
Rebecca stiffly replied. "I come from Peltonville,
New Hampshire, myself. Perhaps I'd ought
to introduce myself. My name's Rebecca Wise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
daughter of Wilmot and Nancy Wise, both deceased."</p>

<p>She concluded her sentence with more of graciousness
than she had shown in the beginning, and the
Queen, now fully convinced of the innocent sincerity
of her visitor, showed a countenance of half-amused,
half-eager interest.</p>

<p>"Why, Sir Walter," she cried, "this cometh within
your province, methinks. If that this good woman
be an American, you should be best able to parley
with her and learn her will."</p>

<p>A dark-haired, stern-visaged man of middle height,
dressed less extravagantly than his fellows, acknowledged
this address by advancing and bending one
knee to the deck. Here was no longer the gay young
courtier who so gallantly spoiled a handsome cloak
to save his sovereign's shoes, but the Raleigh who
had fought a hundred battles for the same mistress
and had tasted the bitterness of her jealous cruelty
in reward.</p>

<p>There was in his pose and manner, however, much
of that old grace which had first endeared him to
Elizabeth, and even now served to fix her fickle favor.</p>

<p>"Most fair and gracious Majesty," he said in a low,
well-modulated voice, turning upward a seeming fascinated
eye, "what Walter Raleigh hath learned of
any special knowledge his sovereign hath taught him,
and all that he is is hers of right."</p>

<p>"'Tis well, my good knight," said Elizabeth, beckoning
with her slender finger that he might rise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
"We know your true devotion and require now this
service, that you question this stranger in her own
tongue concerning her errand here and her quality
and estate at home."</p>

<p>As Raleigh rose and advanced toward Rebecca,
without turning away from the Queen, the half-bewildered
American brought the end of her umbrella
sharply down upon the floor with a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"What everlastin' play-actin' ways!" she snapped.
Then, addressing Sir Walter: "Say, Mr. Walter," she
continued, "ef you can't walk only sideways, you
needn't trouble to travel clear over here to me. I'll
come to you."</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, Rebecca stepped
briskly forward until she stood in front of the rather
crestfallen courtier.</p>

<p>He rallied promptly, however, and marshalling by
an effort all he could remember of the language of
the red man, he addressed the astonished Rebecca
in that tongue.</p>

<p>"What's that?" she said.</p>

<p>Again Sir Walter poured forth an unintelligible
torrent of syllables which completed Rebecca's disgust.</p>

<p>With a pitying smile, she folded her hands across
her stomach.</p>

<p>"Who's loony now?" she said, quietly.</p>

<p>Raleigh gazed helplessly from Rebecca to the
Queen and back again from the Queen to Rebecca.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Elizabeth, who had but imperfectly heard what
had passed between the two, leaned forward impatiently.</p>

<p>"What says she, Raleigh?" she demanded. "Doth
she give a good account?"</p>

<p>"Good my liege," said Raleigh, with a despairing
gesture, "an the dame be from America, her tribe
and race must needs be a distant one, placed remote
from the coast. The natives of the Floridas&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Florida!" exclaimed Rebecca. "What you talkin'
about, anyway? That's away down South. I come
from New Hampshire, I tell you."</p>

<p>"Know you that region, Raleigh?" said the Queen,
anxiously.</p>

<p>Raleigh shook his head with a thoughtful expression.</p>

<p>"Nay, your Majesty," he replied. "And if I might
venture to hint my doubts&mdash;" He paused.</p>

<p>"Well, go on, man&mdash;go on!" said the Queen, impatiently.</p>

<p>"I would observe that the name is an English one,
and 'tis scarce credible that in America, where our
tongue is unknown, any region can be named for an
English county."</p>

<p>"Land sakes!" exclaimed Rebecca, in growing
amazement. "Don't know English! Why&mdash;don't
I talk as good English as any of ye? You
don't have to talk Bible talk to speak English, I sh'd
hope!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth frowned and settled back in her chair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
turning her piercing eyes once more upon her mysterious
visitor.</p>

<p>"Your judgment is most sound, Sir Walter," she
said. "In sooth, 'twere passing strange were our
own tongue to be found among the savages of the
New World! What have ye to say to this, mistress?"</p>

<p>Rebecca turned her eyes from one to the other of
the bystanders, doubtful at first whether or not they
were all in a conspiracy to mock her. Her good
sense told her that this was wellnigh impossible, and
she finally came to the conclusion that sheer ignorance
was the only explanation.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" she exclaimed at last. "I've heerd
tell about how simple Britishers was, but this beats
all! Do you reely mean to tell me," she continued,
vehemently nodding her head at the Queen, "that
you think the's nothin' but Indians in America?"</p>

<p>A murmur of indignation spread through the assembly
caused by language and manners so little
suited to the address of royalty.</p>

<p>"The woman hath lost her wits!" said the Queen,
dryly.</p>

<p>"There 'tis again!" said Rebecca, testily. "Why,
ef it comes to talk of simpletons and the like, I guess
the pot can't call the kettle black!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth gripped the arm of her chair and leaned
forward angrily, while two or three gentlemen advanced,
watching their mistress for the first sign of
a command. At the same moment, a triumphant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
thought occurred to Rebecca, and, dropping her umbrella,
she opened her satchel with both hands.</p>

<p>"Ye needn't to get mad, Mrs. Tudor," she said. "I
didn't mean any offence, but I guess you wouldn't
like to be called a lunatic yerself. See here," she
continued, dragging forth a section of the newspaper
which she had brought with her, "ef you folks won't
believe my word, jest look at this! It's all here in
the newspaper&mdash;right in print. There!"</p>

<p>She held the paper high where all might see, and
with one accord Queen and courtiers craned forward
eagerly, burning with curiosity at sight of the printed
columns interspersed with nineteenth-century illustrations.</p>

<p>Rebecca stepped forward and handed the paper
to the Queen, and then, drawing forth another section
from her bag, she carried it to the bewildered
Raleigh, who took it like one in a trance.</p>

<p>For some time no one spoke. Elizabeth turned
the paper this way and that, reading a bit here and
a bit there, and gazing spellbound upon the enigmatic
pictures.</p>

<p>Having completely mastered the situation, Rebecca
now found time to consider her comfort. Far
on one side, near the door through which she had
entered, there stood a youth of perhaps sixteen, clad
in the somewhat fantastic garb of a page. Having
picked up her umbrella, Rebecca approached this
youth and said in a sharp whisper:</p>

<p>"Couldn't you get me a chair, sonny?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The lad disappeared with startling promptitude,
but he did not return. It was an agony of perplexity
and shyness which had moved him, not a willingness
to serve.</p>

<p>Rebecca gazed about at the etiquette-bound men
and women around her and muttered, with an indignant
snort and toss of the head:</p>

<p>"Set o' decorated haystacks!"</p>

<p>Then, with head held high and a frigid "Beg pardon,
mister!" she elbowed her way through the dense
throng of gentlemen-in-waiting and seated herself on
the bench arranged along the side of the cabin.</p>

<p>"Oof!" she exclaimed. "Feels though my legs
would drop clear off!"</p>

<p>At length the Queen looked up.</p>

<p>"Why, what now!" she exclaimed. "Whither hath
the strange woman gone?"</p>

<p>A tall man dressed in black and gold stepped forward
and dropped upon one knee. He had a long,
humorous face, with high cheek bones, a straight,
good-humored mouth, with a high mustache well off
the lip and a pointed beard. The eyes, set far apart,
twinkled with the light of fun as he awaited permission
to speak.</p>

<p>"Well, my Lord of Southampton," said the Queen,
kindly, "I doubt some gay mischief be afoot. Your
face tells me as much, my lord."</p>

<p>"Nay, my liege," was the humble reply. "Can my
face so far forget the duty owed to Royalty as to
speak thus, not being first admitted to discourse!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Elizabeth smiled and replied:</p>

<p>"Even so, my lord, but we forgive the offence if
that your face hath spoken truth. Know you aught
of the strange woman? Pray be standing."</p>

<p>The earl arose and replied:</p>

<p>"Of her rank and station, she must be a queen at
least, or she doth forget herself. This may your
Majesty confirm if but these your Majesty's servants
be commanded to cross the room."</p>

<p>Elizabeth, puzzled, bowed her head slightly, and
the courtiers behind whom Rebecca had sought rest
walked with one accord to the other side of the cabin,
revealing to the astonished eyes of the Queen her
visitor quietly seated upon the bench.</p>

<p>Rebecca nodded with a pleased look.</p>

<p>"Well, there!" she exclaimed. "Much obliged to
you all. That's certainly better."</p>

<p>"Dame," said Elizabeth, sternly, "is this the respect
you show to them above you in America?"</p>

<p>"Above me!" said Rebecca, straightening up stiffly.
"There ain't anybody put above me at home, I can
tell you. Ef the' was, I'd put 'em down mighty
quick, I guess."</p>

<p>Elizabeth raised her brows and, leaning toward
the lord treasurer, who stood at her side, she said in
an undertone:</p>

<p>"This must be some sovereign princess in her own
country, my lord. How comes it I have not had
earlier intelligence of her arrival in this realm?"</p>

<p>Lord Burleigh bowed profoundly and mumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
something about its being out of his immediate province&mdash;he
would have investigation made&mdash;etc., etc.</p>

<p>The Queen cut him short a little impatiently.</p>

<p>"Let it be done, my lord," she said.</p>

<p>Then turning to Rebecca, she continued:</p>

<p>"Our welcome is somewhat tardy, but none the less
sincere. England hath e'er been friendly to the
American, and you had been more fittingly received
had our informants been less negligent."</p>

<p>Here the Queen shot a glance at poor Sir Walter
Raleigh, who now seemed the personification of discomfiture.</p>

<p>"By what name are you called?" Elizabeth continued.</p>

<p>"Wise," said Rebecca, very graciously, "Rebecca
Wise."</p>

<p>"Lady Rebecca, will you sit nearer?"</p>

<p>Instantly one of the pages sprang forward with a
low chair, which, in obedience to a sign from the
Queen, he placed at her right hand.</p>

<p>"Why, I'd be right pleased," said Rebecca. "That
is, if the other folks don't mind," she continued, looking
around. "I don't want to spile your party."</p>

<p>So saying, she advanced and sat beside the Queen,
who now turned once more to the luckless Raleigh.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir Walter," she said, "what say you now?
You have the printed proof. Can you make aught
of it? How comes it that in all your fine travels in
the New World you have heard no English spoken?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say 'tain't his fault!" said Rebecca,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
indulgently. "I'm told they have a mighty queer
way o' talkin' down South, where he's ben. Comes
o' bein' brought up with darkies, ye know."</p>

<p>Elizabeth took up the newspaper once more.</p>

<p>"Was this printed in your realm, Lady Rebecca?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Hey!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth started haughtily, but recollected herself
and repeated:</p>

<p>"Was this leaf printed in your country?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;yes, indeed! Down to New York.
Pretty big paper, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Not voluminous alone, but right puzzling to
plain English minds," said the Queen, scanning the
paper severely. "Instance this."</p>

<p>Slowly she read the opening lines of a market report:</p>

<p>"The bulls received a solar-plexus blow yesterday
when it was reported that the C. R. and L. directors
had resigned in a body owing to the extensive strikes."</p>

<p>"What words are these?" Elizabeth exclaimed in
a despairing tone. "What is a plexus of the sun, and
how doth it blow on a bull?"</p>

<p>Rebecca jumped up and brought her head close to
the Queen's, peering over the paper which she held.
She read and reread the paragraph in question and
finally resumed her chair, slowly shaking her head.</p>

<p>"I guess that's the Wall Street talk I've heerd tell
of," she said. "I don't understand that kind myself."</p>

<p>"Why, Sir Walter," Elizabeth exclaimed, triumph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>antly,
"here have we two separate tribes at least,
each speaking its proper dialect. Can it be that you
have heard no word of these before?"</p>

<p>"Even so, my liege," was the dejected reply, "the
tribes of the North are known to no man as yet."</p>

<p>"Passing strange!" mused the Queen, running a
critical eye over the printed page before her. "Your
talk, and that of others, hath been only of wild, copper-colored
savages, living in rude huts and wearing
only skins. Sure such as these have not types and
printing-presses! What is this book, Lady Rebecca?"</p>

<p>"That's a newspaper, ma'am. Don't you have 'em
in London? They come out every day an' people
pay a penny apiece fer 'em."</p>

<p>Elizabeth flashed a stern glance upon her visitor.</p>

<p>"'Twere best not go too far, my lady," she said,
harshly. "E'en traveller's tales must in some sort
ape the truth at least. Now, prithee, to what end
is such a pamphlet printed&mdash;why, 'tis endless!"</p>

<p>"I'll shet right up, Mis' Tudor, ef ye think I'm
tellin' wrong stories," said Rebecca, indignantly.
"Thet's a newspaper an' thet's all there is to it."</p>

<p>Elizabeth evaded the issue and turned now to the
illustrations.</p>

<p>"These be quaint-wondrous images!" she said.
"Pray, what now may this be? Some fantastic reverie
limned for amusement?"</p>

<p>Rebecca jumped up again and peered over the
Queen's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why, thet's a picture of the troops marchin' down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Broadway, in New York City. See, it's all explained
in print underneath it."</p>

<p>"But these men carry arquebuses and wear a livery.
And these temples&mdash;to what false gods are they
set up?"</p>

<p>"False gods!" exclaimed Rebecca. "Bless your
simple heart, those ain't temples. They're jest the
buildin's where the men hev their offices."</p>

<p>Elizabeth sat in mute contemplation, vainly seeking
to realize it all.</p>

<p>"My lords!" she burst forth suddenly, casting the
paper violently to the floor, "or this be rank forgery
and fraud or else have we been strangely deceived."</p>

<p>She frowned at Sir Walter, who dropped his
eyes.</p>

<p>"'Tis not to be believed that such vast cities and
great armies habited by peoples polite and learned
may be found across the sea and no report of it come
to them that visit there. How comes it that we must
await so strange a chance as this to learn such weighty
news?"</p>

<p>She paused and only silence ensued.</p>

<p>Rebecca stooped and recovered the paper, which
in falling had opened so as to expose new matter.</p>

<p>"Don't be surprised," she said, soothingly. "I
allus did hear that Britishers knew mighty little
'bout America."</p>

<p>Still frowning, Elizabeth mechanically stretched
forth her hand and Rebecca gave her the paper. The
Queen glanced at the sheet and her face lost its stern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
aspect as she eagerly brought the print nearer to
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, what now!" she exclaimed. "God mend us,
here have we strange attire! Is this a woman of
your tribe, my lady?"</p>

<p>Rebecca looked and blushed. Then, in an uneasy
tone, she said:</p>

<p>"That's jest an advertisement fer a new corset,
Mis' Tudor. I never did see how folks ever allowed
sech things to be printed&mdash;'tain't respectable!"</p>

<p>"A corset, call you it! And these, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, those are the styles, the fashions! That's the
fashion page, ye know. That's where they tell all
about what the rich folks down to New York are
wearin'."</p>

<p>There was a murmur and a rustle among the ladies-in-waiting,
who had hitherto made no sign, and
upon the Queen's cheek there spread an added tinge,
betokening a high degree of interest and gratification.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she sighed, and glanced pleasantly over her
shoulder, "here be matters of moment, indeed!
Your Grace of Devonshire, what say you to this?"</p>

<p>Eagerly the elderly lady so addressed stepped forward
and made a low reverence.</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;look here, ladies all!" Elizabeth continued,
with a tremor of excitement in her voice. "Saw
you ever such an array as this?"</p>

<p>With one accord the whole bevy of assembled ladies
pressed forward, trembling with delighted antici<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>pation.
A fashion sheet&mdash;and from the New World!
What wonder they were moved!</p>

<p>Her Majesty was about to begin perusal of one of
the fascinating paragraphs wherein were described
those marvellous fashion-plates when there was a
cry outside of "Way 'nough!" and a moment later
the smart young lieutenant who had before accosted
Rebecca entered and stood at attention.</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked up and frowned slightly. Folding
the paper carefully, she called to Sir Walter,
who still held in his unconscious hand the other section
of the paper.</p>

<p>"Bring hither yon sheet, Sir Walter," she cried.
"Perchance there may be further intelligence of this
sort therein. We will peruse both pamphlets at our
leisure anon."</p>

<p>Then, turning to the Lord High Admiral:</p>

<p>"My Lord of Nottingham," she said, "you may
depart. Your duties await you without. Let it be
the charge of your Grace," she continued, addressing
the Duchess of Devonshire, "to attend her Highness
the Lady Rebecca. See that she be maintained as
suits her rank, and let her be near our person that
we may not lose aught of her society."</p>

<p>The ceremony of landing prevented further discourse
between Rebecca and the Queen, and it was
with the greatest interest that the stranger observed
every detail of the formal function.</p>

<p>Peering through the glass sides of the cabin, Rebecca
could see the landing wharf, thronged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
servants and magnificently dressed officers, while beyond
there loomed a long, two-storied white stone
building, with a round-arched entrance flanked by
two towers. This was Greenwich Palace, a favorite
summer residence of the Queen.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE FAT KNIGHT AT THE BOAR'S HEAD</h3>


<p>When Francis Bacon, having evaded Rebecca's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
mistaken pursuit, reached the deserted grove in
which the Panchronicon still rested, he found to his
dismay that Droop was absent.</p>

<p>Copernicus was not the man to let the grass grow
under his feet, and he had set off that morning with
his letter of introduction to seek Sir Percevall Hart,
the Queen's knight harbinger.</p>

<p>He had determined to begin with moderation, or
in other words to ask at first for only two patents.
The first of these was to cover the phonograph. The
second was to give him a monopoly of bicycles.</p>

<p>Accordingly he set forth fully equipped, carrying
a box of records over his shoulder by a strap and his
well-oiled bicycle trundling along beside him, with
a phonograph and small megaphone hung on the
handle-bar. He thought it best to avoid remark by
not riding his wheel, being shrewdly mindful of the
popular prejudice against witchcraft. Thanks to his
exchange with Master Bacon, he feared no comment
upon his garb. A pint flask, well filled, was concealed
within his garments, and thus armed against even
melancholy itself, he set forth fearlessly upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
quest.</p>

<p>Droop had set out from the Panchronicon in the
middle of the forenoon, but, as he was obliged to
distribute a large number of photographs among his
customers before going to London, it was not until
some time after Bacon had crossed the river and
Rebecca had departed with the Queen that he found
himself on London Bridge.</p>

<p>On reaching the London side, he stood awhile in
the ill-smelling street near the fish markets gazing
about him in quest of someone from whom he might
ask his way.</p>

<p>"Let's see!" he mused. "Bacon said Sir Percevall
Hart, Boar's Head Tavern, Eastcheap. First thing
to find is Eastcheap, I guess. Hullo there, forsooth!"
he cried, addressing a baker's boy who was shuffling
by with his basket on his head. "Hullo there, boy&mdash;knave!
What's the shortest cut to Eastcheap?"</p>

<p>The lad stopped and stared hard at the bright
wheels. He seemed thinking hard.</p>

<p>"What mean you, master, by a cut?" he said, at
length.</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw&mdash;bother!" Droop exclaimed. "Jest
tell me the way to Eastcheap, wilt thee?"</p>

<p>The boy pointed straight north up New Fish
Street.</p>

<p>"Eastcheap is yonder," he said, and turned away.</p>

<p>"Well, that's somethin'," muttered Droop. "Gives
me a start, anyway."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Following the route pointed out, he retraced the
very course along which earlier in the day Rebecca
had proceeded in the opposite direction, thinking she
saw him ahead of her. By dint of making numerous
inquiries, he found himself at length in a region of
squalid residences and second-rate shops and ale-houses,
in the midst of which he finally discovered
the Boar's Head Tavern.</p>

<p>The entrance was by a dark archway, overhung
by the upper stories of the building, down which he
could see a reddish glow coming and going, now faint
now bright, against the dead wall to the left. Passing
cautiously down this passage, he soon found that
the glow was projected through a half-curtained
window to the right, and was caused by the dancing
light of a pleasant fire of logs within.</p>

<p>He thought it wise to reconnoitre before proceeding
farther, and, peeping through the small leaded
panes, he found he could survey the entire apartment.</p>

<p>The room into which Droop stood gazing was the
common tap-room of the inn, at that moment apparently
the scene of a brisk altercation.</p>

<p>To the left of the great brick fireplace, a large
pewter mug in his right hand, an immensely fat man
was seated. He was clad as became a cavalier, although
in sober colors, and his attitude was suggestive
of defence, his head being drawn far back to
avoid contact with a closed fist held suggestively before
his face. The fist was that of a woman who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
standing before the fire with her other hand resting
on her hip, was evidently delivering her sentiments
in no gentle terms.</p>

<p>A long table, black with age and use, stood parallel
to the right-hand wall, and behind this three men
were sitting with mugs before them, eying the disputants
with evident interest. To the left a large
space was devoted to three or four bulky casks, and
here an aproned drawer sat astride of a rush-bottomed
chair, grinning delightedly and exchanging nods and
winks from time to time with an impish, undersized
lad who lay on his stomach on a wine-butt with his
head craning forward over the edge.</p>

<p>Only an occasional word reached the watcher at
the window, but among these few he recognized a
number which were far more forcible than decent.
He drew back, shook his head, and then slowly returned
to the door and looked up.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;he had made no mistake. Above his head
there swung the sign of the Boar's Head. And yet&mdash;was
it likely or even possible that Sir Percevall
Hart could make such a vulgar haunt as this his
headquarters? Sir Percevall&mdash;the Queen's harbinger
and the friend of the Prime Minister!</p>

<p>With a sinking heart and a face clouded with anxiety,
Droop propped his bicycle against the wall
within the passage and resolutely raised the heavy
latch.</p>

<p>To his surprise, instead of the torrent of words
which he had expected to hear when he opened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
door, complete silence reigned as he entered. The
fat man in the chair by the fire was still leaning backward,
but his tankard was now inverted above his
head, and a glance showed that his companions at
the long table were similarly employed.</p>

<p>Copernicus turned about and closed the door very
carefully, unwilling to break the profound silence.
Then he tiptoed his way to the fire, and leaning forward
rubbed his hands before the crackling logs,
nervously conscious of six pairs of eyes concentrated
upon his back. Droop was not unfamiliar with the
bar-rooms of such a city as Boston, but he found an
Elizabethan tavern a very different sort of place. So,
although already warmer than desirable, he could
only stand half bent before a fire all too hot and
wonder what he should do next.</p>

<p>Finally he mustered courage enough to turn about
and survey with shamefaced mien the tavern interior.
As he turned the four guests dropped their eyes with
painful unanimity and the drawer fell to scouring
a pewter mug with his apron. Only the boy perched
on the cask kept his eyes obstinately fixed on the
stranger.</p>

<p>Droop now noticed for the first time that behind
the casks there was a snug recess containing a table
and two well-worn benches, evidently intended for
the entertainment of guests desirous of a <i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p>Thither he at once directed his steps, and seating
himself upon one of the benches, looked about him
for a bell. He could hear the three men at the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
table whispering busily, and could see that they had
their heads together.</p>

<p>The fat man stirred in his chair with a rolling
motion.</p>

<p>"Drawer!" he called.</p>

<p>"Here!" cried the drawer, bustling up to the fire.</p>

<p>"A second tankard of that same sack, boy. Bustle,
bustle!"</p>

<p>"I must first to my mistress, sir," was the reply.
"Nothing for credit, sir, save by permission."</p>

<p>"A pox upon thee!" growled the thirsty man. "On
thee and thy mistress, too!"</p>

<p>Muttering and shaking his head, the ponderous
guest stretched forth his legs, closed his eyes, and
composed himself for a nap.</p>

<p>The drawer tipped a wink to the grinning pot-boy
on the cask, and then bustled over to Droop's table,
which he proceeded to wipe vigorously with his apron.</p>

<p>"Did you call, sir?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Copernicus. "Bring me a schooner of
light lager."</p>

<p>The drawer's busy apron hand stopped at once and
its owner leaned hard on the table.</p>

<p>"What command gave you, sir?" he said.</p>

<p>"Marry&mdash;a schooner of lager&mdash;light, forsooth!"
Droop repeated.</p>

<p>"Cry you mercy, sir," said the drawer, straightening
up, "this be the Boar's Head Tavern, sir. What
may your worship require by way of food and
drink?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"These old-timers beat all creation for ignorance,"
muttered Droop. Then, looking up into the man's
face, he called for one drink after another, watching
hopefully for some sign of answering intelligence.</p>

<p>"Give me a Scotch high-ball. No? Then a gin
sling. Hot Tom and Jerry, then. Marry, an egg
flip, i' faith! Ain't got 'em? Get me a brandy smash&mdash;a
sherry cobbler&mdash;a gin rickey&mdash;rock and rye&mdash;a
whisky sour&mdash;a mint julep! What! Nothin'? What
in thunder <i>do</i> ye sell, then?"</p>

<p>The drawer scratched his head, and then grinned
suddenly and gave vent to a dry laugh.</p>

<p>"Well said! Well said, master! The jest is a
merry one&mdash;call me a Jew else!" Then, sobering
as briskly as he had taken to laughing: "Will you
have a cup of sack, master, to settle the stomach
after fasting&mdash;or a drop of Canary or Xeres or a
mug of ale, perchance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's right, by my halidom!" Droop broke in.
"Bring me some ale, waiter."</p>

<p>The drawer whisked away and returned in a few
moments with a huge power tankard topped with a
snowy foam.</p>

<p>"That's the stuff!" said Droop, smacking his lips.
He half-emptied the beaker, and then, turning to the
drawer:</p>

<p>"Can you tell me," he said, "if I can find a man
by the name of Hart here&mdash;Sir Percevall Hart?"</p>

<p>"Sir Percevall," said the drawer, in an undertone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
"Why, there's your man, master. The fat knight
snoring by yon fire."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Droop. "The man who&mdash;"
He broke off and stared awhile in silence. Finally,
shaking his head: "Never would have thought it!"
he said.</p>

<p>Copernicus lapsed into meditation and the drawer
withdrew. At length Droop roused himself with a
shake.</p>

<p>"Won't do no good to set here doin' nothin'," he
muttered. Then, swallowing the remainder of his
ale, he drew his letter of introduction from his pocket
and walked back to the fireplace.</p>

<p>The knight, who was not sleeping very soundly,
slightly opened one eye, and to his surprise, beheld
a letter which Droop held almost under his nose.</p>

<p>Sitting up straight and now fully awake, Sir Percevall
stared first at Copernicus and then at the
letter.</p>

<p>"A letter!" he exclaimed. "For me?"</p>

<p>"Verily, yea," Droop replied, very politely.</p>

<p>The knight opened the letter slowly and turned
so that the light from a window fell full upon it.</p>

<p>"What's here!" he exclaimed. "This direction is
to my Lord Burleigh."</p>

<p>"Yep&mdash;oh, yes, yea!" said Droop, confusedly.
"But you was to read it&mdash;peruse it, you wot&mdash;Bacon
said as much. He said you knew the lord and could
take me around, forsooth, and sorter interduce me,
ye see."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>With leisurely gravity, Sir Percevall slowly read
the note, and then, returning it with a polite gesture:</p>

<p>"This letter hath reference to certain monopolies,"
he said. "My cousin Bacon doth write in high terms
of your skill and high merit, Master&mdash;Master&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Droop, sir. Copernicus Droop's my name."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! And the service you require&mdash;? I beg
your indulgence, but, sooth to say, being nigh starved
of late in this tavern of ill repute, my poor wits have
grown fat. I am slow of apprehension, Master
Wither&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Droop, sir&mdash;Droop."</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;cry you mercy&mdash;Master Droop."</p>

<p>"Why, now, Sir Percy," said Copernicus, with oily
grace, "ef you wouldn't mind, I'd be proud ef you'd
set down over yonder, perchance, and have a glass
with me. We'd be more private then, and I could
make this hull business clear to ye. What say ye,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Why, there's my hand, Master Dupe&mdash;Droop,"
said the knight, his face brightening mightily. "Five
yards are a mile for a man of my girth, Master
Droop, but praise God such words as these of yours
cheer my heart to still greater deeds than faring a
mile afoot."</p>

<p>Slowly and painfully the corpulent knight drew
himself to his feet, and with one hand bearing affectionately
but heavily on Droop's shoulder, he shuffled
over to the recess and seated himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"What ho, there! Drawer!" he shouted, as soon
as they were comfortably disposed face to face.</p>

<p>"Anon, sir, anon!" came the familiar reply, and
the drawer, who had just served two new guests at
the long table, now hurried over to the nook behind
the casks.</p>

<p>"A quart of sack, villain!" said Sir Percevall.</p>

<p>"And for you, sir?" said the drawer, turning to
Droop.</p>

<p>"Yes, yea, bring me the same." He had no idea
what sack was, but he felt that in all probability it
was a mild beverage, or no one would order a quart
at once.</p>

<p>"And this same letter, now," Sir Percevall began.
"To warn you truly, friend, this matter of monopolies
hath something of an ill savor in the public mind.
What with sweet wines, salt, hides, vinegar, iron, oil,
lead, yarn, glass, and what not in monopoly, men
cry out that they are robbed and the Queen's advisers
turn pale at the very word."</p>

<p>He interrupted himself to give his attention to the
wine which had just been placed before him.</p>

<p>"To better acquaintance!" he said, and the two
drank deep together.</p>

<p>Droop smacked his lips critically and turned up
his eyes for greater abstraction. The wine was pleasant
to the palate, he thought, but&mdash;well&mdash;it wasn't
whiskey.</p>

<p>"Of this letter, now," the knight resumed, anxious
to discover his own advantage in Droop's plans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
"'Twere vain for you, a stranger to the Lord High
Treasurer, to accost him with it. A very circumspect
and pragmatical old lord, believe me. Not every
man hath admittance to him, I promise ye. As for
me, why, God 'ild you, man! 'twas but yesterday a
fortnight Burleigh slapped me o' the shoulder and
said: 'Percevall, ye grow fat, you rogue&mdash;on the
word of a Cecil!' Oh, trust me, Master Droop; my
lord much affects my conversation!"</p>

<p>"Is that a fact?" said Droop, admiringly. "It certainly
ain't done your conversation any harm to be
affected that way."</p>

<p>"Oh, then, an you jest, Master&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not a mite!" exclaimed Copernicus, anxiously.
"Verily, nay, friend. Trust me&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"Or never trust thee!" quoth the knight, with a
twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>Droop took refuge in his wine, and Sir Percevall
imitating him, the two emptied their cups together
and sighed with a simultaneous content.</p>

<p>"That's not bad swizzle," said Droop, patronizingly.
"But, as fer me, give me whiskey every time!"</p>

<p>"Whiskey!" said the knight with interest. "Nay,
methought I knew every vintage and brew, each label
and brand from Rhine to the Canaries. But this
name, Master Droop, I own I never heard. Whiskey,
say you?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, do tell!" said Droop, drawing forth
his flask of nineteenth-century rye, "never heerd o'
whiskey, eh? Never tasted it, either, I s'pose?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"How should I taste it, man, not knowing its very
name?"</p>

<p>"Verily, thou sayest sooth!" said Droop. Then,
glancing all about him: "Ain't there any smaller
glasses 'round here?"</p>

<p>"Drawer&mdash;ho, drawer, I say!" roared the knight.</p>

<p>"Here, sir&mdash;here! What is your pleasure?"</p>

<p>"The pleasure is to come, rogue! Fetch hither
two of yon scurvy glass thimbles you wot of. Hostess
calls them cordial glasses. Haste now! Scramble,
varlet!"</p>

<p>When the two small glasses were brought, Droop
uncorked his flask and poured each full to the brim.</p>

<p>"Th' ain't any seltzer in this one-hoss town," he
said, "so I can't make ye a high-ball. We'll jest hev
to drink it straight, Sir Knight. Here's luck! Drink
hearty!" and with a jerk of hand and head he tossed
the spirits down his throat at a gulp and smacked his
lips as he set down his glass.</p>

<p>Sir Percevall followed his friend's movements with
a careful eye and imitated him as exactly as possible,
but he did not escape a coughing fit, from which he
emerged with a purple face and tear-filled eyes.</p>

<p>"Have another?" said Droop, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"A plague on queezy gullets!" growled the knight.
"Your spirits sought two ways at once, Master Droop,
and like any other half-minded equivocal transaction,
contention was the outcome. But for the whiskey,
mind you&mdash;why, it hath won old Sir Percevall's
heart. Zounds, man! Scarce two fingers of it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
yet I feel the wanton laugh in me a'ready. Good
fellows need good company, my master! So pour
me his fellow! So&mdash;so!"</p>

<p>They drank again, and this time the more cautious
knight escaped all painful consequences.</p>

<p>"Look you, Master Droop," said the delighted old
toper, leaning back against the wall as he beamed
across the table at his companion, "look you! An
you have a butt of this same brew, Sir Percevall
Hart is your slave, your scullion, your foot-boy!
Why, man, 'tis the elixir of life! It warms a body
like a maid's first kiss! Whence had you it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they make it by the million gallons a year
where I come from," Droop replied. "Have another.
Take it with hot water and sugar&mdash;I mean honey."</p>

<p>The advice was followed, and while they sipped
the enlivening decoction, Copernicus explained his
plans touching the patenting of his phonograph and
bicycle. When he concluded his relation, the knight
leaned back and gazed at him with an affectionate
squint.</p>

<p>"See, now, bully rook, if I take you," he said.
"It behooves you to have fair inductance at court.
For this ye come to Sir Percevall Hart, her Majesty's
harbinger and&mdash;though he says so himself&mdash;a good
friend to Cecil. Now, mark me, lad. Naught do I
know or care of thy 'funny craft' or 'bicycle.' Master
Bacon is a philosopher and you have here his certificate.
Say I well&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>He paused and Droop nodded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good&mdash;and so to better. Naught care I, or know
I, or should or could I trow, being a man of poetical
turn and no base mechanic&mdash;no offence meant to
yourself, Master Droop. But this I do say&mdash;and now
mark me well&mdash;I say&mdash;and dare maintain it (and all
shall tell ye that is a fair maintenance and a good
champion), that for a sure and favorable inductance
to the favors of the court there's no man living takes
the wall o' Percevall Hart, Knight!"</p>

<p>"Bacon told me as much," said Droop.</p>

<p>"And he told thee well, my master. Frank is a
good lad, though vain, and his palm itcheth. So to
terms, eh? Now, methinks 'twere but equity and
good fellowship for two such as we are to go snacks,
eh? Cut through the middle&mdash;even halves, bully&mdash;even
halves! How say you?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean," said Droop, "that you'd want
half the profits, jest fer introducin' me to Lord
What's-is-name, do ye?"</p>

<p>"With a small retainer, of course, to bind fast.
Say&mdash;oh, a matter of twenty gold angels or so."</p>

<p>"Why, blame your confounded overstretched
skin!" cried Droop, hotly, "I'd sooner drop the hull
darn thing! You must take me fer a nat'ral born
fool, I guess!"</p>

<p>"Nay, then&mdash;'twixt friends," said the knight,
soothingly. "'Twixt friends, say we remit one half
the profits. Procure me but the angels, Master
Droop, and drop the remainder."</p>

<p>"As many devils sooner!" said Droop, indignantly.
"I'll take my pigs to another market."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>He rose and beckoned to the drawer.</p>

<p>"Nay, then, why so choleric!" pleaded the knight,
leaning anxiously across the table. "What terms do
ye offer, Master Droop? Come, man, give a show of
reason now&mdash;name your terms."</p>

<p>It was to this point that Copernicus had counted
upon bringing the helpless knight, who was far from
a match for a Yankee. He had driven his own
bargain with Bacon, and he now resolved that Bacon's
friend should fare no better. In pursuit of
this plan, he moved from his seat with a sour face.</p>

<p>"I don't feel much like takin' up with a man who
tries to do me," he grumbled, shaking his head and
beckoning again to the drawer.</p>

<p>"Do thee, man&mdash;do thee!" cried the knight.
"Why, an I do thee good, what cause for grief?"
Spreading forth his two fat hands, he continued:
"Spake I not fairly? An my offer be not to thy
taste&mdash;say thine own say. What the devil, man;
must we quarrel perforce?"</p>

<p>Droop scratched his head and seemed to hesitate.
Finally he slapped the table with his open hand and
cried with a burst of generosity:</p>

<p>"I'll tell ye what I <i>will</i> do. I've got two quart
bottles of that same ripe whiskey, and I'll give 'em
both to ye the day the Queen gives me my patents!"</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;nay!" said the knight, straightening himself
with dignity. "'Twere a mere fool's prank at
such terms!"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right!" cried Droop, turning away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold&mdash;hold! Not so fast!" cried Sir Percevall.
But Copernicus merely slapped his hat on his head
and started toward the door.</p>

<p>Sir Percevall leaned over the table in flushed desperation.</p>

<p>"Listen, friend!" he cried. "Wilt make a jolly
night of it in the bargain?"</p>

<p>Droop stopped and turned to his companion.</p>

<p>"D'ye mean right now?"</p>

<p>A nod was the reply.</p>

<p>"And you'll take my offer if I do?"</p>

<p>The knight sat upright and slapped the table.</p>

<p>"On my honor!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Then it's a go!" said Droop.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">HOW SHAKESPEARE WROTE HIS PLAYS</h3>


<p>As Francis Bacon returned to London from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Peacock, Ph&oelig;be had stood at the foot of the steps
leading into the courtyard and watched him depart.
She little foresaw the strange adventure into which
he was destined to lead her sister. Indeed, her
thoughts were too fully occupied with another to
give admittance to Rebecca's image.</p>

<p>Her lover was in danger&mdash;danger to his life and
honor. She knew he was to be saved, yet was not
free from anxiety, for she felt that it was to be her
task to save him. To this end she had sent Bacon
with his message to Copernicus. She believed now
that a retreat was ready for young Fenton. How
would her confidence have been shaken could she
have known that Copernicus had already left the
Panchronicon and that Bacon had been sent in vain!</p>

<p>In ignorance of this, she stood now at the foot of
the stairs and let her thoughts wander back to the
day before, dwelling with tenderness upon the memory
of her lover's patient attendance upon her in
that group of rustic groundlings. With a self-reproachful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
ache at the heart she pictured herself as
she had sat far up in the gallery gazing downward
with every faculty centred upon the stage, while he,
thinking only of her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She started and looked quickly to right and left.
Why, it was here, almost upon these very stones, that
he had stood. Here she had seen him for one moment
at the last as she was leaving her seat. He
was leaning upon a rude wooden post. She sought
it with her eyes and soon caught sight of it not ten
feet away.</p>

<p>Then she noticed for the first time that she was
not alone. A young fellow in the garb of a hostler
stood almost where Guy had been the day before.
He paid no attention to Ph&oelig;be, for he was apparently
deeply preoccupied in carving some device
upon the very post against which Guy had leaned.</p>

<p>Already occupied with her own tenderness, she
was quick to conclude that here, too, was a lover,
busy with some emblem of affection. Had not Orlando
cut Rosalind's name into the bark of many a
helpless tree?</p>

<p>Clasping her hands behind her, she smiled at the
lad with head thrown back.</p>

<p>"A wager, lad!" she cried. "Two shillings to a
groat thou art cutting a love-token!"</p>

<p>The fellow looked up and tried to hide his knife.
Then, grinning, he replied:</p>

<p>"I'll no take your challenge, mistress. Yet, i' good
faith, 'tis but to crown another's work."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, pointing with his blade:</p>

<p>"See where he hath carved letters four," he continued.
"Wi' love-links, too. A watched un yestre'en,
whiles the play was forward. A do but carve
a heart wi' an arrow in't."</p>

<p>She blushed suddenly, wondering if it were Guy
who had done this. Stepping to the side of the stable-boy,
she examined the post.</p>

<p>The letters were in pairs. They were M. B. and
G. F.</p>

<p>Her feeling bubbled over in a little half-stifled
laugh.</p>

<p>"Silly!" she exclaimed. Then to the boy: "Know
you him who cut the letters?" she asked, with affected
indifference.</p>

<p>"Nay, mistress," he replied, falling again to his
work, "but he be a rare un wi' the bottle."</p>

<p>"The bottle!" Ph&oelig;be exclaimed, in amazement.
Then quite sternly: "Thou beliest him, knave! No
more sober&mdash;" She checked herself, suddenly conscious
of her indiscretion.</p>

<p>"Why, how knowest his habits?" she asked, more
quietly.</p>

<p>"A saw un, mistress, sitting in the kitchen wi'
two bottles o' Spanish wine. Ask the player else."</p>

<p>"The player! What player?"</p>

<p>"Him as was drinking wi' him. Each cracked his
bottle, and 'twas nip and tuck which should call first
for the second."</p>

<p>So Guy had spent the evening&mdash;those hours when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
she was tenderly dreaming of him with love renewed&mdash;drinking
and carousing with some dissolute actor!</p>

<p>Within her Ph&oelig;be Wise and Mary Burton struggled
for mastery of her opinion.</p>

<p>What more natural than that a poor lad, tired
with waiting on his feet for hours for one look from
the mistress who disdained him, should seek to forget
his troubles quaffing good wine in the company
of some witty player? This was Mary's view.</p>

<p>What! To leave the presence of his sweetheart&mdash;the
girl to whom he had just written that penitent
letter&mdash;to go fresh from the inspiration of all that
should uplift a lover, and befuddle his brains with
"rum," gossiping with some coarse-grained barn-stormer!
So Ph&oelig;be railed.</p>

<p>"Who was the player?" she asked, sharply.</p>

<p>"Him as wore the long white beard," said the boy.
"The Jew, to wit. Eh, but a got his cess, the runnion!"</p>

<p>"Shylock!" she cried, in spite of herself.</p>

<p>So this was the gossiping barn-stormer, the dissolute
actor. Will Shakespeare it was with whom her
Guy had spent the evening! Ph&oelig;be Wise could but
capitulate, and Mary Burton took for a time triumphant
possession of the heart that was Guy Fenton's.</p>

<p>"Have the players left the Peacock?" she asked,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Nay, mistress, know you not that they play to-night
at the home of Sir William Percy?"</p>

<p>"Then they are here, at the inn, boy?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"A saw him that played the Jew i' the garden not
a half hour since. He's wont to wander there and
mutter the words of the play. I'll warrant him there
now, mistress."</p>

<p>Here, indeed, was good fortune! Shakespeare was
in the garden. He should tell her where to find Guy
that she might warn him. Quickly she turned away
and hurried out of the yard and around the north L,
beyond which was the garden, laid out with ancient
hedges and long beds of old-fashioned flowers.</p>

<p>Now this same garden was the chief pride of the
neighborhood, the more especially that gardens were
but seldom found attached to inns in those days.
Here there had been a partly successful attempt to
imitate Italian landscape gardening; but the elaborately
arranged paths, beds, and parterres, with their
white statues and fountains, lost their effectiveness
closed in as they were by high walls of vine-covered
brick. It was rumored that once a stately peacock
had here once flaunted his gorgeous plumage, giving
his name to the inn itself&mdash;but this legend rested
upon little real evidence.</p>

<p>When Ph&oelig;be reached the entrance to the main
walk she stopped and looked anxiously about her.
Nowhere could she see or hear anyone. Sadly disappointed,
she moved slowly forward, glancing quickly
to right and left, still hoping that he whom she sought
had not utterly departed.</p>

<p>She reached a small stone basin surmounted by a
statue of Plenty, whose inverted horn suggested a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
copious stream long since choked up. Behind the
fountain there was a stone bench with a high back.
Peeping behind this, Ph&oelig;be found that a second seat
was placed beyond the back, inviting a seclusion
whose expected purpose was distinctly suggested by
a sly little Cupid on a pedestal, holding one forefinger
to his smiling lips.</p>

<p>At this moment Ph&oelig;be was conscious of a distant
mumbling to her left, and, glancing quickly in that
direction, she saw a plainly dressed, bareheaded man
of medium height just turning into the main walk
out of a by-path, where he had been hidden from
view by a thick hedge of privet. His eyes were
turned upon some slips of paper which he held in
one hand.</p>

<p>Could this be he? Shakespeare! The immortal
Prince of Poets!</p>

<p>To Mary Burton, the approach of a mere player
would have given little concern. But Ph&oelig;be Wise,
better knowing his unrivalled rank, was seized with
a violent attack of diffidence, and in an instant she
dodged behind the stone seat and sat in hiding with
a beating heart.</p>

<p>The steps of the new-comer slowly approached.
Ph&oelig;be knew not whether pleasure or a painful fear
were stronger within her. Here was indeed the culmination
of her strange adventure! There, beyond
the stone which mercifully concealed her, He was
approaching&mdash;the wondrous Master Mind of literature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Would he go by unheeding? Could she let him
pass on without one glance&mdash;one word? And yet,
how address him? How dare to show her face?</p>

<p>The slow steps ceased and at the same time he
fell silent. She could picture him gazing with unconscious
eyes at the fountain while within he listened
to the Genius that prompted his majestic
works. Again the gravel creaked, and then she knew
that he had seated himself on the other bench. The
two were sitting back to back with only a stone partition
between them.</p>

<p>To her own surprise, the diffidence which had oppressed
her seemed now to be gradually passing off.
She still realized the privilege she enjoyed in thus
sharing his seat, but perhaps Mary Burton was gaining
her head as well as her heart, for she positively
began to think of leaving her concealment, contemplating
almost unmoved a meeting with her demi-god.</p>

<p>Then he spoke.</p>

<p>"The infant first&mdash;then the school-boy," he muttered.
"So far good! The third age&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;"
There was a pause before he proceeded, slowly and
distinctly:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
"Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br />
Sighing his heart out in a woful ballad&mdash;
</div>

<p>m&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;Ah!&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">Made to his mistress' eyebrow."</div>

<p>He chuckled audibly a moment, and then, speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
a little louder:</p>

<p>"Fenton to the life, poor lad!" he said.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be sat up very straight with a startled movement.
Oh, to think of it! That she should have
forgotten Sir Guy! To have sought Will Shakespeare
for the sole purpose of tracing her threatened
lover&mdash;and then to forget him for a simple name&mdash;a
mere celebrity!</p>

<p>Unconscious of the small inward drama so near
at hand, the playwright proceeded with his composition.</p>

<p>"'Sighing his heart out,'" he mused. "Nay, that
were too strong a touch for Jacques. Lighter&mdash;lighter."
Then, after a moment of thought: "Ay&mdash;ay!"
he chuckled. "'Sighing like furnace'&mdash;poor
Fenton! How like a very furnace in his dolor! Yet
did he justice to the Canary. So&mdash;so! To go back
now:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
"Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br />
Sighing like furnace with a woful ballad<br />
Made to his mistress' eyebrow."
</div>

<p>'Twill pass, in sooth, 'twill pass!"</p>

<p>Lightly Ph&oelig;be climbed onto the bench and peeped
over the back. She looked down sidewise upon the
author, who was writing rapidly in an illegible hand
upon one of his paper slips.</p>

<p>There was the head so familiar to us all&mdash;the
domelike brow, the long hair hanging over the ears.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
This she could see, but of his face only the outline
of his left cheek was visible. Strange and unexpected
to herself was the light-hearted calm with
which, now that she really saw him, she could contemplate
the great poet.</p>

<p>He ceased writing and leaned against the back,
gazing straight ahead.</p>

<p>"The third age past, what then? Why the soldier,
i' faith&mdash;the soldier&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<div class="blockquote">Full of strange oaths"</div>

<p>came a mischievous whisper from an invisible
source&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">"and bearded like the pard.</span><br />
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br />
Seeking the bubble reputation<br />
Even in the cannon's mouth."
</div>

<p>For a moment the poet sat as though paralyzed
with astonishment. Then rising, he turned and faced
the daring girl.</p>

<p>Now she saw the face so well remembered and yet
how little known before. Round it was and smooth,
save for the small, well-trimmed mustache above the
beautifully moulded mouth and chin&mdash;sensitive yet
firm. But above all, the splendid eyes! Eyes of
uncertain color that seemed to Ph&oelig;be mirrors of
universal life, yet just now full of a perplexed admiration.</p>

<p>For she was herself the centre of a picture well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
fitted to arrest a poet's attention. Her merry face
was peering over the smooth white stone, with four
pink finger-tips on each side clinging for greater security.
Behind her a cherry-tree was dropping its
snowy blossoms, and two or three had fallen unheeded
upon her wavy brown hair, making a charming
frame for the young eyes and tender lips whose
smiling harmony seemed to sing with arrant roguishness.</p>

<p>With a trilling laugh, half-suppressed, she spoke
at last.</p>

<p>"A penny for your thoughts, Master Shakespeare!"
she said.</p>

<p>The mood of the astonished player had quickly
yielded to the girl's compelling smile, and his fine
lips opened upon a firm line of teeth.</p>

<p>"'Show me first your penny,'" he quoted.</p>

<p>"I'll owe you it."</p>

<p>He laughed and shook his head.</p>

<p>"That would I not my thoughts, damsel."</p>

<p>"Pay them, then. Pay straightway!" she pouted,
"and see the account be fair."</p>

<p>"Nay, then," he replied, bowing half-mockingly,
"an the accountant be so passing fair, must not the
account suffer in the comparison?"</p>

<p>The face disappeared for a moment, and then
Ph&oelig;be emerged from behind the stone rampart,
dusting her hands off daintily one against the
other.</p>

<p>"Did not your wit exceed your gallantry, sir," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
said, courtesying slightly, "I had had my answer
sooner."</p>

<p>Shakespeare was somewhat taken aback to see a
developed young woman, evidently of gentle birth,
where he had thought to find the mere prank-loving
child of some neighboring cottager. Instantly his
manner changed. Bowing courteously, he stepped
forward and began in a deferential voice:</p>

<p>"Nay, then, fair mistress, an I had known&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut&mdash;tut!" she interrupted, astonished at her own
boldness. "You thought me a chit, sir. Let it pass.
Pray what think you of my lines?"</p>

<p>"They seemed the whisper of a present muse," he
said, gayly, but with conviction in his voice. "'Twas
in the very mood of Jacques, my lady&mdash;a melancholy
fellow by profession&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Holding that light which another might presently
approve"&mdash;she broke in&mdash;"and praise bestowing on
ill deserts in the mere wantonness of a cynic wit!
What!&mdash;doth the cap fit?"</p>

<p>The amazement in her companion's face was irresistible,
and Ph&oelig;be burst forth into a spontaneous
laugh of purest merriment.</p>

<p>"'A hit&mdash;a hit&mdash;a very palpable hit!'" she quoted,
clapping her hands in her glee.</p>

<p>"Were not witches an eldritch race," said Shakespeare,
"you, mistress, might well lie under grave
suspicion."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what! Do I not fit the wizened stamp
of Macbeth's sisters three?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Shakespeare flung out his arms with a gesture of
despair.</p>

<p>"Yet more and deeper mystery!" he cried. "My
half-formed plots&mdash;half-finished scraps&mdash;the clear
analysis of souls whose only life is here!" he tapped
his forehead. "Say, good lady, has Will Shakespeare
spoken, perchance, in sleep&mdash;yet e'en so, how
could&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off and coming to her side, spoke earnestly
in lowered tones.</p>

<p>"Tell me. Have you the fabled power to read the
soul? Naught else explains your speech."</p>

<p>"Tell me, sir, first the truth," said Ph&oelig;be. "In all
sadness, Master Shakespeare, have you had aught
from Francis Bacon? I mean by way of aid in writing&mdash;or
e'en of mere suggestion?"</p>

<p>"Bacon&mdash;Francis Bacon," said he, evidently at a
loss. "There was one Nicholas Bacon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, 'tis of his son I speak."</p>

<p>"Then, in good sooth, I can but answer 'No,' mistress;
since that I knew not even that this Nicholas
had a son."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be heaved a sigh of relief and then went on
with a partial return of her former spirit.</p>

<p>"Then all's well!" she exclaimed. "I am a muse
well pleased; and now, an you will, I'll teach you
straight more verses for your play."</p>

<p>"As you like it," said Shakespeare, bowing, half-amused
and wholly mystified.</p>

<p>"Good!" she retorted, brightly. "'As You Like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
It' shall you name the piece, that henceforth this our
conversation you may bear in mind."</p>

<p>Smiling, he took up his papers and wrote across
the top of one of them "As You Like It" in large
characters.</p>

<p>"Now write as I shall bid you," Ph&oelig;be said.
"Pray be seated, good my pupil, come."</p>

<p>Then, seated there by Ph&oelig;be's side, the poet committed
to paper the whole of Jacques's speech on "The
Seven Ages," just as Ph&oelig;be spoke it from her memory
of the Shakespeare club at home.</p>

<p>When he ceased scribbling, he leaned forward with
elbows on his knees and ran his eyes slowly and wonderingly
over each line in turn, whispering the
words destined to become so famous. Ph&oelig;be leaned
a little away from her companion, resting one hand
on the bench, while she watched his face with a smile
that slowly melted to the mood of dreamy meditation.
They sat thus alone in silence for some time, so still
that a wren, alighting on the path, hopped pecking
among the stones at their very feet.</p>

<p>At length the poet, without other change in position,
turned his head and looked searchingly and
seriously into the young girl's eyes. What amazing
quality was it that stamped its impress upon the
maiden's face&mdash;a something he had never seen or
dreamed of? Even a Shakespeare could give no
name to that spirit of the future out of which she
had come.</p>

<p>"Is it then true?" he said, in an undertone. "Doth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the muse live? Not a mere prompting inward sense,
but in bodily semblance visiting the poet's eye? Or
art thou a creature of Fancy's colors blended, feigning
reality?"</p>

<p>Never before had the glamour of her situation so
penetrated her to whom these words were addressed.
She was choked by an irrepressible sob that was half
a laugh, and a film of moisture obscured her vision.
With a sudden movement, she seized the poet's hand
and pressed it to her lips. Then, half-ashamed, she
rose and turned away to toy with the foliage of a
shrub that stood beside the path.</p>

<p>"Nay, then!" Shakespeare cried, with something
like relief in his voice, "you are no insubstantial spirit,
damsel. Yet would I fain more clearly comprehend
thee!"</p>

<p>There was a minute's pause ere Ph&oelig;be turned
toward the speaker, that spirit of mischief dancing
again in her eyes and on her lips.</p>

<p>"I am Mary Burton, of Burton Hall," she
said.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed. And then again: "Oh!" with
much of understanding and something of disappointment.</p>

<p>"Is all clear now?" she asked, roguishly.</p>

<p>Shakespeare rose, and, shaking one finger playfully
at her, he said:</p>

<p>"Most clear is this&mdash;that Sir Guy knows well to
choose in love; although, an I read you aright, my
Mistress Mockery, his wife is like to prove passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
mettlesome. For the rest, your lover knows poor
Will Shakespeare's secrets&mdash;his Macbeth and half-written
Hamlet. 'Tis with these you have made so
bold to-day! My muse, in sooth! Oh, fie&mdash;fie!"
And he shook his head, laughing.</p>

<p>"Indeed! In very sooth!" said Ph&oelig;be, with merry
sarcasm. "And was it, then, Guy who brought me
these same lines of Jacques the melancholy?" And
she pointed to the papers in his hand.</p>

<p>"Nay, there I grant you," said the poet, shaking
his head, while the puzzled expression crept once
more into his face.</p>

<p>"Ay, there, and in more than this!" Ph&oelig;be exclaimed.
"You have spoken of Hamlet, Master
Shakespeare. Guy hath told me something of that
tragedy. This Prince of Denmark is a most unhappy
wight, if I mistake not. Doth he not once
turn to thought of self-murder?"</p>

<p>"Ay, mistress. I have given Sir Guy my thoughts
on the theme of Hamlet, and have told him I planned
a speech wherein should be made patent Hamlet's
desperate weariness of life, sickened by brooding on
his mother's infamy."</p>

<p>"'To be or not to be, that is the question,'" quoted
Ph&oelig;be. "Runs it not so?"</p>

<p>"This passes!" cried Shakespeare, once more all
amazement. "I told not this to your friend!"</p>

<p>"Nor did I from Guy receive it," said Ph&oelig;be.
"Tell me, Master Shakespeare, have you yet brought
that speech to its term?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," he replied, "nor have I found the task an
easy one. Much have I written, but 'tis all too
slight. Can you complete these lines, think you?"</p>

<p>"My life upon it!" she cried, eagerly.</p>

<p>He shook his head, smiling incredulously.</p>

<p>"You scarce know what you promise," he said.
"Can one so young&mdash;a damsel, too&mdash;sound to its bitter
deeps the soul of Hamlet!"</p>

<p>"Think you so?" Ph&oelig;be replied, her eyes sparkling.
"Then what say you to a bargain, Master Shakespeare?
You know where Sir Guy Fenton may be
found?"</p>

<p>"Ay, right well! 'Tis a matter of one hour's ride."</p>

<p>"So I thought," she said. "Hear, then, mine offer.
I must perforce convey a message straight that
touches the life and honor of Sir Guy. To send my
servant were over-dangerous, for there may be
watchers on my going and coming. Will you go,
sir, without delay, if that I speak for you the missing
lines completing young Hamlet's soliloquy?"</p>

<p>Shakespeare looked into her face for a few moments
in silence.</p>

<p>"Why, truly," he said at last, "I have here present
business with my fellow-player Burbidge." He
paused, and then, yielding to the pleading in her
eyes: "Yet call it a bargain, mistress," he said.
"Speak me the lines I lack and straightway will I
take your word to Sir Guy."</p>

<p>"Now blessings on thee!" cried Ph&oelig;be. "Give me
straight the line you last have written."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>At once the poet began:</p>

<p>"When he himself might his quietus make&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With a bare bodkin"&mdash;broke in the excited girl.
"Who would fardels bear, to grunt and sweat beneath
a weary life, but that the thought of something
after death&mdash;the undiscovered country from whose
bourne no traveller returns&mdash;puzzles the will, and
makes us rather bear the ills we have than fly to
others that we know not of. Thus conscience does
make cowards of us all, and so the native hue of
resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of
thought, and enterprises of great pith and moment
by this regard their currents turn awry and lose the
name of action."</p>

<p>"No more&mdash;no more!" cried Shakespeare, in an
ecstasy. "More than completely hast thou made thy
bargain good, damsel unmatchable! What! Can it
be! Why here have we the very impress of young
Hamlet's soul&mdash;'To grunt and sweat beneath a weary
life'&mdash;feel you not there compunction and disgust,
seeing in life no cleanly burden, but a 'fardel' truly,
borne on the greasy shoulders of filthy slaves!"</p>

<p>He turned and paced back and forth upon the
gravel, repeating without mistake and with gestures
and accents inimitable the lines which Ph&oelig;be had
dictated. She watched him, listening attentively,
conscious that what she saw and heard, though given
in a moment, were to be carried with her forever;
convinced as well that she was for something in this,
and thankful while half afraid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Reaching the end of the soliloquy, Shakespeare
turned to the maiden, who was still standing, backed
by the warm color of a group of peonies.</p>

<p>"Nay, but tell me, damsel," he cried, appealingly.
"Explain this power! Art thou, indeed, no other
than Mary Burton?"</p>

<p>How refuse this request? And yet&mdash;what explanation
would be believed? Perhaps, if she had time,
she thought, some intelligible account of the truth
would occur to her.</p>

<p>"And have you forgot your bargain so soon?" she
said, reproachfully shaking her head. "Away, friend,
away! Indeed, the matter is urgent and grave. If,
when you return, you will ask for Mary Burton,
knowing your task fulfilled, she may make clear for
you what now must rest in mystery."</p>

<p>"You say well," he replied. "Give me your message,
and count fully on Will Shakespeare to carry
it with all despatch and secrecy."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be's face grew grave as she thought of all that
depended on her messenger. She stepped closer to
her companion and glanced to right and left to make
sure they were still alone. Then, drawing from her
finger a plain gold ring, she offered it to her companion,
who took it as she spoke.</p>

<p>"If you will show this to Sir Guy," she said, "he
will know that the case is serious. It beareth writing
within the circle&mdash;'Sois fidèle'&mdash;do you see?"</p>

<p>"Be faithful&mdash;ay."</p>

<p>"'Twill be an admonition for you both," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Ph&oelig;be, with a faint smile. "Tell him to be in the
lane behind the Peacock garden at sunset to-morrow
even with two good horses, one for himself and one
for me. Tell him to come alone and to travel by
back ways. Bid him in my name&mdash;in God's name&mdash;close
till then, trusting in me that there is need.
Tell him to obey now, that later he may have the
right to command."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Shakespeare. "And now good-by
until we meet again."</p>

<p>A parting pressure of the hand, and he turned to
go to the stables. She stood by the fountain musing,
her eyes fixed on the entrance gate of the garden
until at length a horseman galloped past. He rose
in his stirrups and waved his hand. She ran forward,
swept by a sudden dread of his loss, waving her hands
in a passionate adieu.</p>

<p>When she reached the gate no one was in sight.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">HOW THE FAT KNIGHT DID HOMAGE</h3>


<p>On Rebecca's arrival with the royal attendants at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Greenwich Palace, the Queen had ordered that she
be given a splendid suite of apartments for her own
use, and that she be constantly attended by a number
of young gentlewomen assigned to her establishment.
The news soon spread through the palace that an
American princess or empress had arrived, and she
was treated in every way on the footing of a sort of
inferior royalty. Elizabeth invited her to share
every meal with her, and took delight in her accounts
of the manners and customs of the American
aborigines.</p>

<p>As for Rebecca, she finally yielded to the conviction
that Elizabeth was not Victoria, and found
it expedient to study her companions with a view to
avoiding gross breaches of etiquette. Of these, the
first which she corrected was addressing Elizabeth as
"Mrs. Tudor."</p>

<p>In twenty-four hours the shrewd and resourceful
New England woman was able to learn many things,
and she rapidly found her bearings among the strange
people and stranger institutions by which she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
surrounded.</p>

<p>Seated in her own "presence chamber," as she
called it, surrounded by her civil and assiduous attendants,
she discovered a charm in being constantly
taken care of which was heightened by the contrast
which it presented with her usually independent
habits of life. The pleasing effect of novelty had
never more strongly impressed her.</p>

<p>Her anxiety in Ph&oelig;be's behalf had been dispelled
when she learned that Isaac Burton was expected at
the palace, and was to bring his family with him.
With diplomatic shrewdness, she resolved to improve
every opportunity to win the Queen's favor, in order
that when the time came she might have the benefit
of her authority in removing her younger sister from
her pretended relatives.</p>

<p>It was about five in the afternoon of the day succeeding
her adventure on the Thames, and Rebecca
sat near a window overlooking the entrance court.
She was completing the knitting upon which she had
been engaged when Droop made his first memorable
call on her in Peltonville.</p>

<p>On either side of Rebecca, but on stools set somewhat
lower than her chair, were her two favorites,
the Lady Clarissa Bray, daughter of Walter Bray,
Lord Hunsforth, and the Honorable Lady Margaret
Welsh, daughter of the Earl of March.</p>

<p>Clarissa was employed in embroidering a stomacher
whose green, gold, and russet set off her dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
curls very agreeably. The Lady Margaret was playing
a soft Italian air upon the cithern, which she
managed with excellent taste, to the entertainment
of her temporary mistress and her half dozen attendants.</p>

<p>Rebecca's needles moved in time with the graceful
measure of the music, while her head nodded in unison,
and she smiled now and then.</p>

<p>As the air was concluded she let her hands sink
for a moment into her lap, turning to bend an approving
look upon the fair young musician.</p>

<p>"There, now!" she said. "I declare, Miss Margaret,
that's real sweet music. I'm much obliged to
ye, I'm sure."</p>

<p>Margaret arose and courtesied, blushing.</p>

<p>"Would your Highness that I play again?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"No, thank ye," said Rebecca, resuming her knitting.
"The's no sort o' use in drivin' folks to death
as are kind to ye. Sit right down an' rest now, an'
I'll tell ye all a story thet hez a bearin' right on that
point."</p>

<p>She turned to the four maids of honor seated behind
her.</p>

<p>"Now you girls can jest's well come an' set in
front o' me while I'm talkin'. I'll like it a heap
better, I'm sure."</p>

<p>With great diffidence on the part of her attendants,
and after much coaxing on Rebecca's part, this change
was accomplished. The idea of being seated in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
presence of royalty was in itself quite distasteful to
these young courtiers, but upon this Rebecca had
insisted from the first. It made her feel tired, she
said, to see people standing continually on their feet.</p>

<p>"Well," she began, when all were disposed to their
satisfaction, "it all happened in my country, ye know.
'Twas 'bout ten years ago now, I guess&mdash;or rather
then&mdash;I mean it will be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Clarissa's wondering eyes caught the speaker's attention
and she coughed.</p>

<p>"Never mind when 'twas," she went on. "Ye see,
things are very different here&mdash;time as well's the
rest. However, 'long 'bout then, my cousin Ann
Slocum took a notion to 'nvite me down to Keene
fer a little visit. Ph&oelig;be&mdash;thet's my sister&mdash;she said
I could go jest's well's not, an' so I went. The fust
night I was there, when dinner was over, of course
I offered to wash up the dishes, seem'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>An involuntary and unanimous gasp of amazement
from her fair auditors cut Rebecca short at this point.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, a little anxiously, "what's the
matter? Anythin' wrong?"</p>

<p>The Lady Clarissa ventured to voice the general
sentiment.</p>

<p>"Did we hear aright, your Highness?" she asked.
"Said you&mdash;'wash up the dishes'?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Rebecca, conscious for the first time of
her slip, "did that puzzle ye?"</p>

<p>"Do queens and princesses perform menial offices
in America?" asked the Honorable Lady Margaret.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Short as was the time allowed, it had sufficed for
Rebecca to compose a form of words which should
not wound her conscience by direct falsehood, while
not undeceiving her hearers as to her rank.</p>

<p>"Why, to tell ye the truth," she said, in a semi-confidential
manner, "all the queens and princesses
there are in America wash the dishes after dinner."</p>

<p>There was some whispering among the girls at this,
and Rebecca's ears caught the expressions "passing
strange" and "most wonderful" more than once.</p>

<p>She waited until the first excitement thus produced
had subsided and then proceeded.</p>

<p>"Of course Cousin Ann hadn't no objection, an'
so I went into the kitchen. When we got through,
blest ef she didn't ask me to wash out the dish-towels
while she filled the lamps! Now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The growing amazement in the round, open eyes
and shaking curls of her audience brought Rebecca
once more to a standstill. Evidently some further
explanation of this unwonted state of things would
be expected. To gain time for further invention,
Rebecca rose and carried her knitting to the window
as though to pick up a stitch. Mechanically she
glanced down into the court-yard, where there was
now a large assemblage, and uttered an exclamation
of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Gracious alive!" she cried. "If there ain't a bicycle!
Well, well, don't that look nat'ral, now!
Makes me feel homesick."</p>

<p>She turned to her companions, each of whom was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
ceremoniously standing, but all showing clearly in
their faces the curiosity which consumed them.</p>

<p>"Come 'long!" said Rebecca, smiling. "Come one
and all! I'm blest ef ye don't make me think of Si
Pray's dog waitin' to be whistled fer when Si goes
out to walk."</p>

<p>The obedience to this summons was prompt and
willing, and Rebecca turned again to observe those
who came with the mysterious bicycle.</p>

<p>"Land o' sunshine!" she exclaimed, "did ye ever
see sech a fat man as that! Do any of you girls
know who 'tis?"</p>

<p>"'Tis Sir Percevall Hart, harbinger to the Queen,
I ween," Clarissa replied.</p>

<p>"Gracious!" said Rebecca, anxiously. "I do hope
now he ain't bringin' any <i>very</i> bad news!"</p>

<p>"Wherefore should he, your Highness?" said Clarissa.</p>

<p>"Why, if he's a harbinger of woe&mdash;ain't that what
they call 'em?" she spoke, with some timidity.</p>

<p>"Nay," said the Lady Margaret. "Sir Percevall
is reputed a wit and a pleasant companion, your
Highness. He is harbinger to the Queen."</p>

<p>"An' who's the man with him in black togs an'
rumpled stockin's?" said Rebecca. "The one holdin'
the bicycle?"</p>

<p>"Mean you him holding the two bright wheels,
your Highness?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Lady Margaret could not answer, nor could any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of the other attendants. Could Rebecca have had
a more advantageous view of the stranger, she would
herself have been the only one in the palace to recognize
him. She could only see his hat and his
borrowed clothes, however, and her curiosity remained
unsatisfied.</p>

<p>"That looks like Copernicus Droop's wheel," she
muttered. "I wonder ef somebody's ben an' stole
it while he was away. 'Twould serve him right fer
givin' me the slip."</p>

<p>Then turning to Lady Margaret again, she continued:</p>

<p>"Would you mind runnin' down to ask who that
man is, Miss Margaret? Seems to me I know that
bicycle."</p>

<p>Courtesying in silence, the maid backed out of the
room and hurried down the stairs quite afire with the
eagerness of her curiosity. This strange, bright-wheeled
thing to which the American princess so
easily applied a name, could only be some wonderful
product of the New World. She was overjoyed at
the thought that she was to be the first to closely
examine and perhaps to touch this curiosity.</p>

<p>Her plans were delayed, however, for when she
reached the court-yard she found herself restrained
by a row of men with halberds, one of whom informed
her that her Majesty was returning from
chapel.</p>

<p>The Queen and her retinue were obliged to pass
across the courtyard on the way to the apartment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
where Elizabeth was to take her evening meal. Her
progress at such times was magnificently accompanied,
and was often much delayed by her stopping
to notice her favorites as she passed them, and even
at times to receive petitions.</p>

<p>Copernicus, who, as we have seen, had just arrived,
was inclined to bewail the interruption caused by this
procession, but his companion insisted that, on the
contrary, all was for the best.</p>

<p>"Why, man," said he, "Dame Fortune hath us in
her good books for a surety. What! Could we have
planned all better had we willed it? To meet the
Queen in progress from chapel! 'Twill go hard but
Sir Percevall shall win his suit&mdash;and you, Master
Droop, your monopolies. Mark me now&mdash;mark me
well!"</p>

<p>So saying, the fat knight advanced and joined one
of the long lines of courtiers already forming a hedge
on each side of the direct way which the Queen was
to traverse. Droop, leaning his bicycle against the
palace wall and taking in his hands his phonograph
and box of cylinders, placed himself behind his
guide and watched the proceedings with eager curiosity.</p>

<p>A door opened at one end of the lane between the
two courtiers and there appeared the first of a long
procession of splendidly apparelled gentlemen-in-waiting,
walking bareheaded two by two. Of these,
the first were simple untitled knights and gentlemen.
These were followed by barons, then earls, and lastly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
knights of the garter, each gentleman vying with
the others in richness of apparel and lavish display
of collars, orders, jewelled scabbards, and heavy
chains of gold.</p>

<p>Behind these there came three abreast. These
were the Lord High Chancellor, in wig and robes,
carrying the Great Seal of England in a red silk bag.
On his right walked a gentleman carrying the golden
sceptre, jewelled and quaintly worked, while he on
the left carried the sword of state, point up, in a red
scabbard, studded with golden fleur-de-lis.</p>

<p>A few steps behind this imposing escort came the
Queen, with a small but richly covered prayer-book
in her hand. She looked very majestic on this occasion,
being dressed in white silk bordered with pearls
of the size of beans, over which was thrown a mantle
of black silk shot with silver threads. An oblong
collar of jewelled gold lay upon her otherwise bare
bosom.</p>

<p>The Queen's train was very long and was carried
by a marchioness, whose plain attire set off the magnificence
of royalty.</p>

<p>As Elizabeth proceeded across the yard, she spoke
to one by-stander or another, and Droop, looking on,
made up his mind that the rule was that anyone to
whom she addressed a word, or even a look, should
drop forthwith to his knees and so remain until she
had passed, unless she pleased to extend her hand
to raise him up.</p>

<p>On each side of this main procession there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
single file of five and twenty gentlemen pensioners,
each carrying a gilt battle-axe.</p>

<p>The remainder of the procession consisted of a
train of court ladies all dressed in white and nearly
destitute of ornaments. Evidently the Royal Virgin
would suffer no rivalry in dress from those of her
own sex.</p>

<p>Just behind Elizabeth and to one side, in such a
position as to be within easy reach for consultation,
walked the Lord High Treasurer, William Cecil,
Baron of Burleigh. It was to this nobleman that
his nephew, Francis Bacon, had addressed the letter
which he had given to Copernicus Droop.</p>

<p>By dint of much squeezing and pushing, Sir Percevall
made his way to the front of the waiting line,
and, as Elizabeth approached, he dropped painfully
to his knees, and, with hat in hand, gazed earnestly
into the Queen's face, not daring to speak first, but
with a petition writ large in every feature.</p>

<p>Now, Elizabeth was most jealous of her dignity,
and valued her own favors very highly. In her eyes
it was downright impertinence at a time like this
for anyone to solicit the honor of her attention by
kneeling before he was noticed.</p>

<p>Knowing this, Burleigh, who recognized the
knight and wished him well, motioned to him earnestly
to rise. Alarmed, Sir Percevall made a desperate
effort to obey the hint, and, despite his huge
bulk, would perhaps have succeeded in regaining his
feet without attracting the notice of the Queen but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
for the impatient movement of the crowd behind
him. Unfortunately, however, he had but half risen
when the bustling multitude moved forward a little
against his expansive rear. The result was disastrous.</p>

<p>Sir Percevall lost his balance, and, feeling himself
toppling, threw his hands out forward with a cry and
fell flat on his face.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was at this moment addressing a few
gracious words to a white-haired courtier, who
kneeled among those gathered on the right of her
line of progress. Startled by the loud cry of the
falling knight, she turned swiftly and saw at her
feet a man of monstrous girth struggling in vain
to raise his unwieldy form. His plumed hat had
rolled to some distance, exposing a bald head with
two gray tufts over the ears. His sword stood on
its hilt, with point in air, and his short, fat legs made
quick alternate efforts to bend beneath him&mdash;efforts
which the fleshy knees successfully resisted.</p>

<p>The helpless, jerking limbs, the broad, rolling
body, and the mixture of expletives and frantic apologies
poured forth by the prostrate knight turned the
Queen's first ready alarm to irrepressible laughter,
in which the bystanders joined to their great relief.
Droop alone was grave, for he could only see in this
accident the ruin of his plans.</p>

<p>"Now, by the rood!" cried the Queen, as soon as
she could speak distinctly, "fain would we see your
face, good gentleman. Of all our subjects, not one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
doth us such low obeisance!" Then, beckoning to
those of her gentleman pensioners who stood nearest:</p>

<p>"Raise us yon mighty subject of ours, whose greatness
we might in our majesty brook but ill did not
his humble bearing proclaim a loyal submission."</p>

<p>Four gentlemen, dropping their gilt axes, hastened
to Sir Percevall's aid, raising him by the arms and
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Enough&mdash;enough, lads!" cried the knight, when
they had got him to his knees. "Let it not be said
that Sir Percevall Hart dared to tempt erect the
dreadful glance of majesty. Here let him lowly
bend beneath the eyes that erstwhile laid him low."</p>

<p>Still holding him, the four gentlemen turned their
eyes to the Queen for orders, and Sir Percevall,
clasping his mud-stained hands, addressed himself
directly to Elizabeth, in whose still laughing face he
foresaw success.</p>

<p>"O Majesty of England!" he cried. "Marvel not
at this my sudden fall&mdash;for when, with more than
royal glory is linked the potency of virgin loveliness,
who can withstand!"</p>

<p>"Why, how now, Sir Knight!" said Elizabeth, banteringly.
"Are we less lovely or less awful now than
a moment since? You seem at least one half restored."</p>

<p>"Nay, your Majesty," was the reply. "'Tis his
sovereign's will and high command that stiffens poor
Percy's limbs, and in obedience only that he finds
strength to present his suit."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"A suit!" she exclaimed. "Pride cometh before
a fall, 'tis said. Then, in sooth, by the rule of contraries,
a fall should presage humility's reward.
What says my Lord Baron?"</p>

<p>She turned to Burleigh, who smiled and, bowing,
replied:</p>

<p>"So witty a flight to so sound a conclusion Cecil
could not have winged alone, but where majesty
teacheth wisdom, who shall refuse it!"</p>

<p>"'Tis well!" said Elizabeth, more soberly. "Rise,
Sir Knight, and, when that we have supped, seek
audience again. An the petition be in reason, 'twill
not suffer for the fall you have had."</p>

<p>With this speech, Sir Percevall's first audience
ended, and it was with a happy face that he suffered
himself to be helped to his feet by the four gentlemen
who had first been sent to his aid.</p>

<p>As the Queen resumed her progress and entered
the apartments wherein she was to prepare for her
evening meal, there resounded through the palace
the ringing notes of trumpets and the musical booming
of a kettle-drum.</p>

<p>In a large antechamber immediately outside of the
room where the Queen was to sup there was placed
a splendidly carved table of black oak, and here were
made all the preparations for her repast, accompanied
by the usual ceremonies.</p>

<p>Moving to the sound of trumpets and drum, two
gentlemen entered the room, the first bearing a rod
and the second a table-cloth. Advancing one behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the other, they kneeled three times between the door
and table, apparently expressing the deepest veneration.
Having spread the table, they retired backward,
not forgetting to repeat the genuflections as
performed on their approach.</p>

<p>These first two were followed immediately by two
other gentlemen, the first with a rod and the other
carrying a salt-seller, plates, and bread. These articles
were carried to the table with the same ceremony
as had attended the spreading of the cloth.</p>

<p>Next there entered a young lady, whose coronet
indicated the rank of countess and whose uncovered
bosom proclaimed the unmarried state. She was accompanied
by a married lady of lower rank, carrying
a knife. The Countess rubbed the plates with bread
and salt, and then the two ladies stood awhile by the
table, awaiting the arrival of the supper.</p>

<p>Finally there entered, one at a time, twenty-four
yeomen of the guard, the tallest and handsomest
men in the royal service, bareheaded and clothed in
scarlet coats, with roses embroidered in gold thread
on their backs. Each yeoman carried a separate special
dish intended for the royal repast, and, as each
approached the table, the lady with the knife cut off
and placed in his mouth a portion of the food which
he was carrying. After depositing their dishes upon
the table, the yeomen departed and the maids of
honor then approached and carried the dishes into
the inner room, where the Queen sat at her
supper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all those who thus advanced to the table and
departed walking backward, none omitted the reverent
kneelings, nor did anyone concerned in all this
ceremony speak a word until it was concluded. Although
the Queen was actually absent, in fiction she
was present, and it was to this fiction that so much
reverence was paid.</p>

<p>Shortly after the commencement of these preparations,
Droop and his guide appeared among other
petitioners and other lookers-on around the doorways.
Copernicus carried his phonographic apparatus,
but the bicycle had been left in the court-yard
in the care of a man-at-arms.</p>

<p>"Jiminy!" said Droop, looking curiously about
him, "ain't this A No. 1, though! Et must be fun
to be a queen, eh, Percevall?"</p>

<p>"To speak truly, my lad," said the knight, "there
is something too much of bravery and pomp in the
accidents of royalty. What! Can a king unbend&mdash;be
merry&mdash;a good fellow with his equals? No! And
would you or I barter this freedom for a crown?"
He shook his head. "Which think you passed the
merrier night&mdash;or the Queen (God's blessing on her)
or you and I?"</p>

<p>Droop paid little heed to his companion, for his
eyes were busy with the unwonted scene before him.</p>

<p>"Well, now!" he exclaimed. "Look there, Sir
Knight. See how the old lady digs out a piece o'
that pie and pokes it into that lord's mouth! He
must be mighty hungry! I'm darned ef I'd thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
they'd hev let him hev his grub before the Queen&mdash;and
out of her own dish, too!"</p>

<p>"Nay, Brother Droop," said the Englishman, "this
custom hath its origin in the necessary precaution
of our sovereign. Who knows but that poison be in
this food! Have not a score of scurvy plots been laid
against her life? 'Tis well to test what is meant for
the use of majesty."</p>

<p>Droop whistled low.</p>

<p>"Thet's the wrinkle, eh?" he said. "I don't guess
I'd be much tempted to take a job here as a taster,
then! Hello!" he said. "Why, they're takin' the
victuals out o' the room. What's that fer? Did they
find p'ison in 'em?"</p>

<p>Sir Percevall did not reply. His attention had
been caught by the arrival of a strangely dressed
woman, apparently attended by six maids of honor.</p>

<p>Turning to a gentleman at his elbow:</p>

<p>"Can you tell me, sir," he said, "who is yonder
stranger in outlandish apparel?"</p>

<p>Following the speaker's eyes, the gentleman stared
for a few moments and then replied:</p>

<p>"Marry, sir, it can but be the American princess
with her retinue. They say that her Majesty much
affects this strange new-comer."</p>

<p>It was, indeed, Rebecca who, in response to an
invitation brought by a page in the Queen's livery,
was on the way to take supper with Elizabeth. On
her arrival at the anteroom door, an attendant went
in before the Queen to announce her presence; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
while awaiting admission, Rebecca gazed about her
with a curiosity still unsatisfied.</p>

<p>"There, now," she was saying, "'twas suttenly
too bad to send you off on a wild-goose chase, Miss
Margaret. Ef you could hev found the man, I'd hev
ben glad, though."</p>

<p>At that very moment, a voice close beside her
made her start violently.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well! I declare! Rebecca Wise, how
do you do!"</p>

<p>She turned and saw him of whom she was at that
moment speaking, and lo! to her amazement, it was
Copernicus Droop who held out his right hand.</p>

<p>"Copernicus Droop!" she gasped. Then, remembering
her adventure of the previous day, she went
on coldly, without noticing the proffered hand: "Ye
seem right glad to see me <i>now</i>, Mr. Droop."</p>

<p>Droop was taken aback at her manner and at the
sarcastic emphasis laid upon the word "now."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;of course," he stammered. "I
thought you was lost."</p>

<p>"Lost!" she cried, indignantly. "Lost! Why, you
know right well I chased you up one street and down
the other all the mornin' yesterday. You tried to
lose me, Mr. Droop&mdash;and now you find me again,
you see. Oh, yes, you <i>must</i> be glad to see me!"</p>

<p>Droop was at first all astonishment at this accusation,
but in a few moments he guessed the true
state of the case. Without delay he explained the
exchange of clothes, and had no difficulty in persuad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>ing
Rebecca that it was Francis Bacon whom she
had pursued by mistake.</p>

<p>"Poor young man!" Rebecca exclaimed, in a low
voice of contrition. "Why, he must hev took me
fer a lunatic!"</p>

<p>Then she suddenly recollected her young attendants,
and turned so as to bring them on one hand
and Droop on the other.</p>

<p>"Young ladies," she said, primly, "this here's Mr.
Copernicus Droop, from America."</p>

<p>With one accord the six girls dropped their eyes
and courtesied low.</p>

<p>"Mr. Droop," Rebecca continued, as she indicated
one of the girls after the other with her forefinger,
"make you acquainted with Miss Clarissa, Miss Margaret,
Miss Maria, Miss Gertrude, Miss Evelina, and
Miss Dorothy. They've got sech tangled-up last
names, I declare I can't keep 'em in my head. Mr.
Droop's the same rank I am," she concluded, addressing
the girls.</p>

<p>Droop fidgeted and bowed six awkward bows with
eyes riveted to the ground. He had never been a
ladies' man, and this unexpected presentation was a
doubly trying ordeal.</p>

<p>There was a murmur of "your Highness" from the
courtesying young women which convinced the
abashed Yankee that he was being mocked, and this
impression was deepened by the ill-suppressed giggles
occasioned by the sight of his sadly rumpled
hose. His confusion was complete.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, tell me," said Rebecca, curiously, "whatever
brought you up here? Hev ye some errand
with the Queen?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Droop. "My friend and me came up
here to get a patent. Say," he exclaimed, brightening
up with startling suddenness, "praps you know
the racket&mdash;got the inside track, eh?"</p>

<p>"Inside track!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Don't you know the Patent Examiner&mdash;or
Commissioner, or Lord High Thingummy that
runs the Patent Office here? I hate to bother the
Queen about sech things! Goodness knows, I'd
never ha' thought o' troublin' President McKinley
about patents!"</p>

<p>Rebecca shook her head.</p>

<p>"I'm blest ef I know the fust thing about it," she
declared. "Ef you take my advice, you'll not bother
Miss Elizabeth 'bout your old patents."</p>

<p>At this moment the page returned.</p>

<p>"Her Majesty awaits your Royal Highness within,"
he said, bowing deeply.</p>

<p>Droop's jaws fell apart and his eyes opened wide.</p>

<p>"Royal Highness!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Well, I've got to go now," said Rebecca, smiling
at her friend's astonishment. "But don't you go 'way
fer a while yet. I'll try an' get the Queen to let
you in soon. I want to talk with you 'bout lots of
things."</p>

<p>In a moment she was gone, leaving Copernicus
rooted to the floor and dumb with amazement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Someone touched his elbow and, turning, he saw
Sir Percevall, with the light of triumph on his fat
face.</p>

<p>"Fortune's smiles have turned to mere laughter,
my lad," he said, chuckling. "This American princess
hath the Queen's good-will. How the fiend's
name came you acquainted?"</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE FATE OF SIR PERCEVALL'S SUIT</h3>


<p>In the inner chamber, Elizabeth was seated at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
small table, at the opposite end of which sat Rebecca.
Burleigh, Nottingham, and two or three other great
lords stood near at hand, while one dish after another
was brought in from the outer room by maids
of honor.</p>

<p>Standing to the right of the Queen's chair was a
dark man of foreign aspect, wearing the robes of a
Doctor of Laws. In his hand was Rebecca's copy of
the New York <i>World</i>, which he was perusing with
an expression of the utmost perplexity.</p>

<p>"Well, Master Guido," said the Queen, "what
make you of it?"</p>

<p>"Maestà eccellentissima&mdash;" the scholar began.</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;nay. Speak good plain English, man,"
said the Queen. "The Lady Rebecca hath no Italian."</p>

<p>Messer Guido bowed and began again, speaking
with a scarcely perceptible accent.</p>

<p>"Most Excellent Majesty, I have but begun perusal
of this document. It promiseth matter for ten good
years' research in the comparison of parts, interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of phrases, identifying customs, manners,
dress, and the like."</p>

<p>"Nay, then," said the Queen, "with the help of
the Lady Rebecca, 'twill be no weighty task, methinks.
My lady, why partake you not of the pasty?"
she said, turning to Rebecca. "Hath it not a very
proper savor?"</p>

<p>"My, yes," Rebecca replied; "it's mighty good pie!
Somehow, though, pie don't lay very good with me
these days. Ye don't happen to have any tea, do
ye?"</p>

<p>"Tea!"</p>

<p>"If I may venture&mdash;" said Guido, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Speak, Messer Guido."</p>

<p>"Why, it would appear, your Majesty, that tea is
a sort of stuff for dresses&mdash;silk, belike."</p>

<p>"Stuff for dresses!" said Rebecca. "Stuff and nonsense!
Why, tea's a drink!"</p>

<p>"A beverage! Then how explain you this?" the
Italian cried, triumphantly. Lifting the newspaper,
he read from it the following passage: "The illustration
shows a charming tea-gown, a creation of Mme.
Décolleté."</p>

<p>"You see, Maestà&mdash;your Majesty&mdash;it is clear. A
'tea-gown' is shown in the drawing&mdash;a gown made
of tea."</p>

<p>Rebecca had opened her mouth to overwhelm the
poor savant with the truth when a page entered and
stood before the Queen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, sirrah," said Elizabeth, "what is your
message?"</p>

<p>"Sir Percevall Hart craves an audience, your
Majesty, for himself and his American friend and
client."</p>

<p>"Another American!" exclaimed the Queen.</p>

<p>"Copernicus Droop!" cried Rebecca.</p>

<p>"Know you Sir Percevall's friend, Lady Rebecca?"
asked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, your Majesty. He and I came over
together from Peltonville. I believe he's after a
patent."</p>

<p>"A patent? What mean you? Doth he ask for
a patent of nobility&mdash;a title? Can this be the suit
of the fat knight?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Rebecca. "'Tain't nothin'
'bout nobility, I'm sure, though. It's a patent on a
phonograph, I b'lieve."</p>

<p>"Know you aught of this, my lord?" said Elizabeth,
turning to Burleigh.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, your Majesty. I have to-day received
from Sir Percevall Hart a letter written by my
nephew, Francis Bacon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bacon! What! Ay&mdash;methinks we know somewhat
of this same Francis," said the Queen, grimly.
"A member of Parliament, is he not?"</p>

<p>"Even so, your Majesty," said Burleigh, somewhat
crestfallen. "From this letter I learn," he continued,
while Elizabeth shook her head, "that this
American&mdash;a Master Dupe, I believe&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;Droop!" cried Rebecca. "Copernicus
Droop."</p>

<p>The baron bowed.</p>

<p>"That this Master Droop desires the grant of a
monopoly in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A monopoly!" cried Elizabeth. "What! This
independent young barrister&mdash;this parliamentary
meddler in opposition, forsooth! He craveth a monopoly?
God's death! A monopoly in all the impudence
in this our realm is of a surety this fellow's
right! We grant it&mdash;we grant it. Let the papers
be drawn forthwith!"</p>

<p>The baron bent before the storm and, bowing,
remained silent. Rebecca, however, could scarce see
the justice of the Queen's position.</p>

<p>"Well, but look here, your Majesty," she said.
"'Tain't Mr. Bacon as wants this patent; it's Mr.
Droop. Mr. Bacon only gave him a letter to Mr.
Burleigh here."</p>

<p>Astonishment was depicted in every face save in
that of the Queen, whose little eyes were now turned
upon her sister sovereign in anger.</p>

<p>"Harkye, Lady Rebecca!" she exclaimed. "Is it
the custom to take the Queen to task in your realm?"</p>

<p>Rebecca's reply came pat. The type was prepared
beforehand, and she answered now with a clear conscience.</p>

<p>"Why, of course. We talk jest as we feel like to
all the queens there is in my country."</p>

<p>The equivocation in this reply must have struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the Queen, for she said, without taking her eyes
from Rebecca's face:</p>

<p>"And, prithee, Lady Rebecca, how many queens be
there in America? We begin to doubt if royalty be
known there."</p>

<p>Again Messer Guido evinced signs of an anxious
desire to speak, and Rebecca shrewdly took advantage
of this at once.</p>

<p>"Messer Guido can tell you all 'bout that, I guess,"
she said.</p>

<p>Elizabeth turned her eyes to the savant.</p>

<p>"What knowledge have you of this, learned doctor?"
she asked, coldly.</p>

<p>"Why, your Majesty," said Guido, with delighted
zeal, "the case is plain. Will your Majesty but look
at this drawing on one of the inner pages of the
printed document brought by the Lady Rebecca?
Behold the effigy of a powder canister, with the
words 'Royal Baking Powder' thereon. This would
appear evidence that in America gunpowder is
known and is used by the sovereigns of the various
tribes. Here again we see 'The Royal Corset,' and
there 'Crown Shirts.' Can it be doubted that the
Americans have royal governors?"</p>

<p>The Queen's face cleared a little at this, and Guido
proceeded with increased animation:</p>

<p>"Behold further upon the front page, your Majesty,
the effigy of a man wearing a round crown
with a peak or projecting shelf over the eyes. Under
this we read the legend 'The Czar of the Tender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>loin.'
Now, your Majesty will remember that the
ruler of Muscovy is termed the Czar. The Tenderloin
signifieth, doubtless, some order, akin, perchance,
to the Garter."</p>

<p>"This hath a plausible bent, Messer Guido," said
Elizabeth, with more good-nature. "Lady Rebecca,
can you better explain this matter of the Czar?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," Rebecca replied, with perfect truth.
"Mister Guido must have a fine mind to understand
things like that!"</p>

<p>"In sooth, good Messer Guido," said Elizabeth,
with a smile, "your research and power of logic do
you great credit. We doubt not to learn more of
these new empires from your learned pains than ever
from Raleigh, Drake, and the other travellers whose
dull wits go but to the surface of things. But, Lord
warrant us!" she continued, "here standeth our page,
having as yet no answer. Go, sirrah, and bid Sir
Percevall and this great American to our presence
straight."</p>

<p>Then, turning again to Guido, she said:</p>

<p>"Messer Guido, we enjoin it upon your learning
that you do make a note of the petition of this American,
as well as of those things which he may answer
in explanation of his design."</p>

<p>With a bow, Guido stepped to one side and, carefully
folding the newspaper, drew from his bosom
his tablets and prepared to obey.</p>

<p>All eyes turned curiously to the door as it opened
to admit the two suitors, who were followed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
page. Sir Percevall, with plumed hat in one hand
and sword hilt in the other, advanced ponderously,
bowing low at every other step. Droop hurriedly
deposited his two boxes upon the floor and followed
his monitor, closely imitating his every step and gesture.
Having no sword, he thought it best to put
his left hand into his bosom, an attitude which he
recollected in a picture of Daniel Webster.</p>

<p>The fat knight was about to kneel to kiss the royal
hand, but Elizabeth, smiling, detained him.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay!" she said. "You, Sir Percevall, have
paid your debt of homage in advance for a twelvemonth.
He who kisses the dust at our feet hath
knelt for ten." Then, turning to Droop, who was
down on both knees, with his hand still in his breast:
"What now!" she exclaimed. "Hath your hand suffered
some mischance, Sir American, that you hide
it in your bosom?"</p>

<p>"Not a mite&mdash;not a mite!" Droop stuttered,
quickly extending the member in question. "Nay,
your Majesty&mdash;in sooth, no&mdash;my hand beeth all
right!"</p>

<p>"We learn from the Lord Treasurer," said Elizabeth,
addressing Sir Percevall, "that your petition
hath reference to a monopoly. Know you not, Sir
Knight, that these be parlous days for making of
new monopolies? Our subjects murmur, and 'tis said
that we have already been too generous with these
great gifts. Have you considered of this?"</p>

<p>"My liege," said Sir Percevall, "these things have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
we considered. Nor would we tempt this awful Presence
with petitions looking to tax further the public
patience. But, please your Majesty, Master Droop,
my client here," indicating the still kneeling man
with a sweeping gesture, "hath brought into being
an instrument, or rather two instruments, of marvellous
fashion and of powers strange. Of these your
Majesty's subjects have had hitherto no knowledge,
and it is in the making and selling of these within
this realm that we do here crave a right of monopoly
under the Great Seal."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, forsooth, your Majesty," Droop broke
in, "but would thou mind if I get up, my liege?"</p>

<p>"Nay, rise, rise, Master Droop!" exclaimed the
Queen, smothering a laugh. "We find matter for
favor in your sponsor's speech. Can you more fully
state the nature of this petition?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am&mdash;your Majesty," said Droop, rising
and dusting off his knees. "I am the inventor of a
couple of things, forsooth, that are away ahead of the
age. Marry, yes! I call 'em a bicycle and a phonograph."</p>

<p>"Well, did you ever!" murmured Rebecca, amazed
at this impudent claim to invention.</p>

<p>Messer Guido paused in his writing and began to
unfold his precious American newspaper, while
Droop went on, encouraged by the attentive curiosity
which he had evidently excited in the Queen.</p>

<p>"Now, the bicycle&mdash;or the bike, fer short&mdash;is a
kind of a wagon or vehycle, you wot. When you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
mount on it, you can trundle yerself along like all
possessed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gramercy!" broke in the Queen, in a tone of
irritation. "What have we here! We must have
plain English, Master Droop. American idioms are
unknown to us."</p>

<p>As Droop opened his mouth to reply, Guido
stepped forward with a great rustling of paper.</p>

<p>"May it please your Gracious Majesty&mdash;" he panted,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Speak, Messer Guido."</p>

<p>"I would fain question this gentleman, your Majesty,
touching certain things contained herein." He
shook the paper at arm's length and glared at Droop,
who returned the look with a calm eye.</p>

<p>"You may proceed, sir," said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"Why, Master Droop, you that are the inventor
of this same 'bicycle,' how explain you this?"</p>

<p>He thrust the paper under Droop's nose, pointing
to an advertisement therein.</p>

<p>"Here," he continued, "here have we a picture
bearing the legend, 'Baltimore Bicycle&mdash;Buy No
Other'&mdash;" He paused, but before Copernicus could
speak he went on breathlessly: "And look on this,
Master Droop&mdash;see here&mdash;here! Another drawing,
this time with the legend, 'Edison's Phonographs.'
How comes it that you have invented these things?
Can you invent on this 21st day of May, in the year
of our Lord 1598, what was here set forth as early
as&mdash;as&mdash;" he turned the paper back to the first page,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
"as early as April&mdash;" he stopped, turned pale, and
choked. Droop looked mildly triumphant.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well!" cried Elizabeth, "hast lost thy
voice, man?"</p>

<p>"My liege," murmured the bewildered savant,
"the date&mdash;this document&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is dated in 1898," said Droop, solemnly. "This
here bike and phonograph won't be invented by anyone
else for three hundred years yet."</p>

<p>Elizabeth frowned angrily and grasped the arms
of her chair in an access of wrath which, after a
pause, found vent in a torrent of words:</p>

<p>"Now, by God's death, my masters, you will find
it ill jesting in this presence! What in the fiend's
name! Think ye, Elizabeth of England may be
tricked and cozened&mdash;made game of by a scurvy
Italian bookworm and a witless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The adjectives and expletives which followed may
not be reported here. As the storm of words progressed,
growing more violent in its continuance,
Droop stood open-mouthed, not comprehending the
cause of this tirade. Of the others, but one preserved
his wits at this moment of danger.</p>

<p>Sir Percevall, well aware that the Queen's fury,
unless checked, would produce his and his client's
ruin, determined to divert this flood of emotion into
a new channel. With the insight of genius, the fat
knight realized that only a woman's curiosity could
avert a queen's rage, and with what speed he could
he stumbled backward to where Droop had left his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
exhibits. He lifted the box containing the phonograph
and, taking the instrument out, held it on
the palm of his huge left hand and bent his eyes upon
it in humble and resigned contemplation.</p>

<p>The quick roving eye of the angry Queen caught
sight of this queer assemblage of cogs, levers, and
cylinder, and for the first time her too-ready tongue
tripped. She looked away and recovered herself to
the end of the sentence. She could not resist another
look, however, and this time her words came
more slowly. She paused&mdash;wavered&mdash;and then fixed
her gaze in silence upon the enigmatical device.
There was a unanimous smothered sigh as the bystanders
recognized their good fortune. Guido,
frightened half to death, slipped unobserved out of
a side door, and was never seen at Greenwich again.
Nor has that fatal newspaper been heard from since.</p>

<p>"What may that be, Sir Percevall?" the Queen
inquired at length, settling back in her chair as comfortably
as her ruff would permit.</p>

<p>"This, my liege, is the phonograph," said the
knight, straightening himself proudly.</p>

<p>"An my Greek be not at fault," said the Queen,
"this name should purport a writer of sound."</p>

<p>Sir Percevall's face fell. He was no Greek scholar,
and this query pushed him hard. Fortunately for
him, Elizabeth turned to Droop as she concluded
her sentence.</p>

<p>"Hath your invention this intent, Master Droop?"
she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Verily, I guess you've hit it&mdash;I wot that's right!"
stammered the still frightened man.</p>

<p>A very audible murmur of admiration passed from
one to another of the assembled courtiers and ladies-in-waiting.
These expressions reached the ears of
the Queen, for whom they were indeed intended,
and the consciousness of her acumen restored Elizabeth
entirely to good-humor.</p>

<p>"The conceit is very novel, is it not, my lord?"
she said, turning to Baron Burleigh.</p>

<p>"Novel, indeed, and passing marvellous if achieved,
your Majesty," was the suave reply.</p>

<p>"How write you sounds with this device, Master
Droop?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why, thusly, ma'am&mdash;your Majesty," said Droop,
with renewed courage. "One speaketh, you wot&mdash;talketh-like
into this hole&mdash;this aperture." He
turned and pointed to the mouth-piece of the instrument,
which was still in Sir Percevall's hands. "Hevin'
done this, you wot, this little pin-like pricketh or
scratcheth the wax, an' the next time you go over
the thing, there you are!"</p>

<p>Conscious of the lameness of this explanation,
Droop hurried on, hoping to forestall further questions.</p>

<p>"Let me show ye, my liege, how she works, in
sooth," he said, taking the phonograph from the
knight. Looking all about, he could see nothing at
hand whereon to conveniently rest the device.</p>

<p>"Marry, you wouldn't mind ef I was to set this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
right here on your table, would ye, my liege?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Permission was graciously accorded, and, depositing
the phonograph, Droop hurried back to get his
records. Holding a wax cylinder in one hand, he
proceeded.</p>

<p>"Now, your Majesty can graciously gaze on this
wax cylinder," he said. "On here we hev scrawled&mdash;written&mdash;a
tune played by a cornet. It is 'Home,
Sweet Home.' Ye've heerd it, no doubt?"</p>

<p>"Nay, the title is not familiar," said the Queen,
looking about her. With one accord, the courtiers
shook their heads in corroboration.</p>

<p>"Is that so? Well, well! Why, every boy and
gal in America knows that tune well!" said Droop.</p>

<p>He adjusted the cylinder and a small brass megaphone,
and, having wound the motor, pressed the
starting-button. Almost at once a stentorian voice
rang through the apartment:</p>

<p>"Home, Sweet Home&mdash;Cornet Solo&mdash;By Signor
Paolo Morituri&mdash;Edison Record."</p>

<p>The sudden voice, issuing from the dead revolving
cylinder, was so unexpected and startling that several
of the ladies screamed and at least one gentleman
pensioner put his hand to his sword-hilt. Elizabeth
herself started bolt upright and turned pale under
her rouge as she clutched the arms of her chair. Before
she could express her feelings the cornet solo
began, and the entire audience gradually resumed its
wonted serenity before the close of the air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"Marvellous beyond telling!" exclaimed Elizabeth,
in delight. "Why, this contrivance of yours, Master
Droop, shall make your name and fortune throughout
our realm. Have you many such ingenious gentlemen
in your kingdom, Lady Rebecca?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, yes!" said Rebecca, somewhat contemptuously.
"Copernicus Droop ain't nobody in
America."</p>

<p>Droop glanced reproachfully at his compatriot,
but concluded not to give expression to his feelings.
Accordingly, he very quickly substituted another
cylinder, and turned again to the Queen.</p>

<p>"Now, your Majesty," said he, "here's a comic
monologue. I tell you, verily, it's a side-splitter!"</p>

<p>"What may a side-splitter be, Master Droop?"</p>

<p>"Why, in sooth, somethin' almighty funny, you
know&mdash;make a feller laugh, you wot."</p>

<p>Elizabeth nodded and, with a smile of anticipation,
which was copied by all present, prepared to be
amused.</p>

<p>Alas! The monologue was an account of how a
farmer got the best of a bunco steerer in New York
City, and was delivered in the esoteric dialect of the
Bowery. It was not long before willing smiles gave
place to long-drawn faces of comic bewilderment,
and, although Copernicus set his best example
by artificial grins and pretended inward laughter,
he could evoke naught but silence and bored
looks.</p>

<p>"Marry, sir," said Elizabeth, when the monologue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
was at an end, "this needs be some speech of an
American empire other than that you come from.
Could you make aught of it, Lady Rebecca?"</p>

<p>"Nothin' on airth!" was the reply. "Only a word
now an' then about a farmer&mdash;an' somethin' about
hayseed."</p>

<p>"Now, here's a reg'lar bird!" said Droop, hastily,
as he put in a new cylinder.</p>

<p>"Can you thus record e'en the voices of fowls?"
said the Queen, with renewed interest.</p>

<p>Hopeless of explaining, Droop bowed and touched
the starting-button. The announcement came at
once.</p>

<p>"Liberty Bells March&mdash;Edison Record," and after
a few preliminary flourishes, a large brass band could
be heard in full career.</p>

<p>This proved far more pleasing to the Queen and
her suite.</p>

<p>"So God mend us, a merry tune and full of harmony!"
said the Queen.</p>

<p>"But that ain't all, your Majesty," said Droop.
"Here's a blank cylinder, now." He adjusted it as
he spoke and unceremoniously pushed the instrument
close to the Queen. "Here," he said, "jest you talk
anythin' you want to in there and you'll see suthin'
funny, I'll bet ye!" He was thoroughly warmed to
his work now, and the little court etiquette which
he had acquired dropped from him entirely.</p>

<p>The Queen's eager interest had been so aroused
that she was unconscious of his too familiar manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Leaning over the phonograph as Droop started the
motor, she looked about her and said, with a titter:
"What shall we say? Weighty words should grace
so great an occasion, my lords."</p>

<p>"Oh, say the Declaration of Independence or the
'Charge of the Light Brigade'!" Droop exclaimed.
"Any o' them things in the school-books!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth saw that the empty cylinder was passing
uselessly and wasted no time in discussion, but began
to declaim some verses of Horace.</p>

<p>"M&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;" exclaimed Droop, doubtfully. "I
don't know as this phonograph will work on Latin
an' Greek!"</p>

<p>The Queen completed her quotation and, sitting
back again in her chair:</p>

<p>"Now, Master Droop, we have done our part," she
said.</p>

<p>Droop readjusted the repeating diaphragm and
started the motor once more. There were two or
three squeaks and then an affected little chuckle.</p>

<p>"What shall we say?" it began. "Weighty words
should grace so great an occasion, my lords."</p>

<p>Elizabeth laughed a little hysterically to hear her
unstudied phrase repeated, and then, with a look of
awe, listened to the repetition of the verses she had
recited.</p>

<p>"Can any voice be so repeated?" she asked, seriously,
when this record was completed.</p>

<p>"Anyone ye please&mdash;any ye please!" said the delighted
promoter, visions of uncounted wealth danc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>ing
in his head. "Now, here's a few words was
spoken on a cylinder jest two or three weeks ago
by Miss Wise," he continued, hunting through his
stock of records. "Ah, here it is! It's all 'bout
Mister Bacon&mdash;I daresay you know him." The
Queen looked a little stern at this. "Tells all 'bout
him, I believe. I ferget jest what it said, but we
can soon see."</p>

<p>The cylinder was that before which Ph&oelig;be had
read an extract from the volume on Bacon's supposed
parentage and his writings while she was at the
North Pole. Little did Droop conceive what a train
he was unconsciously lighting as he adjusted the
cylinder in place. As he said, he had forgotten the
exact purport of the extract in question, but, even
had he recollected it, he would probably have so little
understood its terrific import that his course would
have been the same. Ignorant of his danger, he
pushed the starting-button and looked pleasantly at
the Queen, whose dislike of anything having to do
with Francis Bacon had already brought a frown to
her face.</p>

<p>All too exactly the fateful mechanism ground out
the very words and voice of Ph&oelig;be:</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>"It is thus made clear from the indubitable evidence
of the plays themselves, that Francis Bacon
wrote the immortal works falsely ascribed to William
Shakespeare, and that the gigantic genius of this man
was the result of the possession of royal blood. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
this unacknowledged son of Elizabeth Tudor, Queen
of England, was made manifest to all countries and
for all centuries the glorious powers inherent in the
regal blood of England."</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>As the fearful meaning of these words was developed
by the machine, amazement gave place to consternation
in those present and consternation to abject
terror. Each fear-palsied courtier looked with
pale face to right and left as though to seek escape.
The fat knight, hitherto all complacency, listening
to this brazen traducer of the Queen's virgin honor,
seemed to shrink within himself, and his very clothing
hung loose upon him.</p>

<p>Droop and Rebecca, ignorant of the true bearing
of the spoken words, gazed in amazement from one
to another until, glancing at the Queen, their eyes
remained fixed and fascinated.</p>

<p>The unthinkable insult implied in the words repeated
was trebled in force by being spoken thus
publicly and in calm accents to her very face. She&mdash;the
daughter of Henry the Eighth; she&mdash;Elizabeth
of England&mdash;the Virgin Queen&mdash;to be thus
coolly proclaimed the mother of this upstart barrister!</p>

<p>As a cyclone approaches, silent and terrific, visible
only in the swift swirling changes of a livid and
blackened sky, so the fatal passion in that imperial
bosom was known at first only in the gleaming of her
black eyes beneath contorted brows and the spas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>modic
changes that swept over the pale red-painted
face.</p>

<p>The danger thus portended was clear even to the
bewildered Droop, and, before the instrument had
said its say, he began to slip very quietly toward the
door.</p>

<p>As the speech ended, Elizabeth emitted a growl
that grew into a shriek of fury, and, with her hair
actually rising on her head, she threw herself bodily
upon the offending phonograph.</p>

<p>In her two hands she raised the instrument above
her, and with a maniac's force hurled it full at the
head of Copernicus Droop.</p>

<p>Instinctively he dodged, and the mass of wood and
steel crashed against the door of the chamber, bursting
it open and causing the two guards without to
fall back.</p>

<p>Droop saw his chance and took it. Turning, with
a yell he dashed past the guards and across the antechamber
to the main entrance-hall. The Queen,
choked with passion, could only gasp and point her
hand frantically after the fleeing man, but at once
her gentlemen, drawing their swords, rushed in a
body from the room with cries of "Treason&mdash;treason!
Stop him! Catch him!"</p>

<p>Down the main hallway and out into the silent
court-yard Droop fled on the wings of fear, pursued
by a shouting throng, growing every moment larger.</p>

<p>As he emerged into the yard a sentry tried to
stop him, but, with a single side spring, the Yankee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
eluded this danger and flung himself upon his bicycle,
which he found leaning against the palace wall.</p>

<p>"Close the gates! Trap him!" was the cry, and
the ponderous iron gates swung together with a clang.
But just one second before they closed, the narrow
bicycle, with its terror-stricken burden, slipped
through into the street beyond and turned sharply
to the west, gaining speed every instant. Droop had
escaped for the moment, and now bent every effort
upon reaching the Panchronicon in safety.</p>

<p>Then, as the tumult of futile chase faded into silence
behind the straining fugitive, there might have
been seen whirling through the ancient streets of
London a weird and wondrous vision.</p>

<p>Perched on a whirl of spokes gleaming in the moonlight,
a lean black figure in rumpled hose, with flying
cloak, slipped ghostlike through the narrow streets
at incredible speed. Many a footpad or belated
townsman, warned by the mystic tinkle of a spectral
bell, had turned with a start, to faint or run at sight
of this uncanny traveller.</p>

<p>His hat was gone and his close-cropped head bent
low over the handle-bars. The skin-tight stockings
had split from thigh to heel, mud flew from the tires,
beplastering the luckless figure from nape to waist,
and still, without pause, he pushed onward, ever onward,
for London Bridge, for Southwark, and for
safety. The way was tortuous, dark and unfamiliar,
but it was for life or death, and Copernicus Droop
was game.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">HOW REBECCA RETURNED TO NEWINGTON</h3>


<p>Within the palace all was confusion and dismay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Only a very few knew the cause of this riot which
had burst so suddenly upon the wonted peace of the
place, and those few never in all their lives gave utterance
to what they had learned.</p>

<p>Within the presence chamber Elizabeth lay on the
floor in a swoon, surrounded by her women only.
Among these was Rebecca, whose one thought was
now to devise some plan for overtaking Droop. From
the window she had witnessed his flight, and she had
guessed his destination. She felt sure that if Droop
reached the Panchronicon alone, he would depart
alone, and then what was to become of Ph&oelig;be and
herself?</p>

<p>Just as the Queen's eyes were opening and her
face began to show a return of her passion with recollection
of its cause, Rebecca had an inspiration, and
with the promptitude of a desperate resolution, she
acted upon it.</p>

<p>"Look a-here, your Majesty!" she said, vigorously,
"let me speak alone with you a minute and I'll save
you a lot of trouble. I know where that man keeps
more of them machines."</p>

<p>This was a new idea to Elizabeth, who had destroyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
as she supposed, the only existing specimen
of the malignant instrument.</p>

<p>With a gesture she sent her attendants to the opposite
end of the room.</p>

<p>"Now speak, woman! What would you counsel?"
she said.</p>

<p>"Why, this," said Rebecca, hurriedly. "You don't
want any more o' them things talkin' all over London,
I'm sure."</p>

<p>A groan that was half a growl broke from the
sorely tried sovereign.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't. Well&mdash;I told you him and
I come from America together. I know where he
keeps all his phonograph things, and I know how to
get there. But you must be quick or else he'll get
there fust and take 'em away."</p>

<p>"You speak truly, Lady Rebecca," said the Queen.
"How would you go&mdash;by what conveyance? Will
you have horses&mdash;men-at-arms?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" was the reply. "Jest let me hev a
swift boat, with plenty o' men to row it, so's to go
real fast. Then I'll want a carryall or a buggy in
Southwark&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A carryall&mdash;a buggy!" Elizabeth broke in.
"What may these be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, any kind of a carriage, you know, 'cause I'll
hev to ride some distance into the country."</p>

<p>"But why such haste?" asked the Queen. "Had
this American a horse?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>"He had a bicycle an' that's wuss," said Rebecca.
"But ef I can start right away and take a short cut
by the river while he finds his way through all them
dirty, dark streets, I'll get there fust an' get the rest
of his phonographs."</p>

<p>"Your wit is nimble and methinks most sound,"
said the Queen, decisively. Then, turning to the
group of ladies, she continued:</p>

<p>"Send us our chamberlain, my Lady Temple, and
delay not, we charge you!"</p>

<p>In ten minutes Rebecca found herself once more
upon the dark, still river, watching the slippery
writhings of the moonbeams' path. She was alone,
save for the ten stalwart rowers and two officers; but
in one hand was her faithful umbrella, while in the
other she felt the welcome weight of her precious
satchel.</p>

<p>The barge cut its way swiftly up the river in
silence save for the occasional exclamations of the
officers urging the willing oarsmen to their utmost
speed.</p>

<p>Far ahead to the right the huge bulk of the Tower
of London loomed in clumsy power against the deep
dark blue of the moonlit sky. Rebecca knew that
London Bridge lay not far beyond that landmark,
although it was as yet invisible. For London Bridge
she was bound, and it seemed to her impatience that
the lumbering vessel would never reach that goal.</p>

<p>She stood up and strained her eyes through the
darkness, trying to see the laboring forms of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
rowers in the shadow of the boat's side, but only the
creak of the thole-pins and the steady recurrent
splash and tinkle from the dripping oars told of their
labor.</p>

<p>"Air ye goin' as fast as ye can?" she called. "Mr.
Droop'll get there fust ef ye ain't real spry."</p>

<p>"If spry be active, mistress," said a voice from
the darkness aft, "then should you find naught here
amiss. Right lusty workers, these, I promise you!
Roundly, men, and a shilling each if we do win the
race!"</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;ay, sir!" came the willing response, and Rebecca,
satisfied that they could do no more, seated
herself again, to wait as best she might.</p>

<p>At length, to her great delight, there arose from
the darkness ahead an uneven line of denser black,
and at a warning from one of the officers the boat
proceeded more cautiously. Rebecca's heart beat
high as they passed under one of the low stone arches
of the famous bridge and their strokes resounded in
ringing echoes from every side.</p>

<p>Having passed to the upper side of the bridge, the
boat was headed for the south shore, and in a few
moments Rebecca saw that they had reached the side
of a wooden wharf which stood a little higher than
their deck. One of the officers leaped ashore with
the end of a rope in his hand, and quickly secured
the vessel. As he did so a faint light was seen proceeding
toward them, and they heard the steps of a
half dozen men advancing on the sounding planks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
It was the watch, and the light shone from a primitive
lantern with sides of horn scraped thin.</p>

<p>"Who goes there?" cried a gruff voice.</p>

<p>"The Queen's barge&mdash;in the service of her Majesty,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>The watchman who carried the lantern satisfied
himself that this account was correct, and then asked
if he could be of service.</p>

<p>"Tell me, fellow," said he who had landed, "hast
seen one pass the bridge to-night astride of two
wheels, one before the other, riding post-haste?"</p>

<p>There was a long pause as the watchman sought
to comprehend this extraordinary question.</p>

<p>"Come&mdash;come!" cried the officer, who had remained
on the boat. "Canst not say yes or no, man?"</p>

<p>"Ay, can I, master!" was the reply. "But you had
as well ask had I seen a witch riding across the moon
on a broomstick. We have no been asleep to dream
of flying wheels."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well!" said he who had landed. "Go you
now straight and stand at the bridge head. We shall
follow anon."</p>

<p>The watch moved slowly away and Rebecca was
helped ashore by the last speaker.</p>

<p>"Our speed hath brought us hither in advance,
my lady," he said. "Now shall we doubtless come
in before the fugitive."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope so!" said Rebecca. Then, with a
smothered cry: "Oh, Land o' Goshen! I've dropped
my umbrella!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>They stooped together and groped about on the
wharf in silence for a few moments. The landing
was encumbered with lumber and stones for building,
and, as the moon was just then covered by a
thick cloud, the search was difficult.</p>

<p>"I declare, ain't this provokin'!" Rebecca cried,
at length.</p>

<p>"These beams and blocks impede us," said the officer.
"We must have light, perforce. Ho there!
The watch, ho! Bring your lanthorn!"</p>

<p>"Why, 'tain't worth while to trouble the watchman,"
said Rebecca. "I'll jest strike a light myself."</p>

<p>She fumbled in her satchel and found a card of
old-fashioned silent country matches, well tipped
with odorous sulphur. The officer at her side saw
nothing of her movements, and his first knowledge
of her intention was the sudden and mysterious appearance
of a bluish flame close beside him and the
tingle of burning brimstone in his nostrils.</p>

<p>With a wild yell, he leaped into the air and then,
half crazed by fear, tumbled into the boat and cut
the mooring-rope with his sword.</p>

<p>"Cast off&mdash;cast off!" he screamed. "Give way,
lads, in God's name! A witch&mdash;a witch! Cast off!"</p>

<p>A gentle breeze off the shore carried the sulphurous
fumes directly over the boat, and these, together
with their officer's terror-stricken tones and the sight
of that uncanny, sourceless light, struck the crew
with panic. Fiercely and in sad confusion did they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
push and pull with boat-hook and oar to escape from
that unhallowed vicinity, and, even after they were
well out in the stream, it was with the frenzy of
superstitious horror that they bent their stout backs
to their oars and glided swiftly down stream toward
Greenwich.</p>

<p>As for Rebecca&mdash;comprehending nothing of the
cause of this commotion at first&mdash;she stood with open
mouth, immovable as a statue, watching the departure
of her escort until the flame reached her fingers.
Then, with a little shriek of pain, she flicked the
burnt wood into the river.</p>

<p>"Well, if I ever!" she exclaimed. "I'm blest ef
I don't b'lieve those ninnies was scared at a match!"</p>

<p>Shaking her head, she broke a second match from
her card, struck it, and when it burned clear, stooped
to seek her umbrella. It was lying between two
beams almost at her feet, and she grasped it thankfully
just as her light was blown out by the breeze.</p>

<p>Then, with groping feet, she made her way carefully
toward the inshore end of the wharf, and soon
found herself in the streets of Southwark, between
London Bridge and the pillory. From this point she
knew her way to the grove where the Panchronicon
had landed, and thither she now turned a resolute
face, walking as swiftly as she dared by the light of
the now unobscured moon.</p>

<p>"If Copernicus Droop ketches up with me," she
muttered, "I'll make him stop ef I hev to poke my
umbrella in his spokes."</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">HOW SIR GUY KEPT HIS TRYST</h3>


<p>For one hour before sunset of that same day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Ph&oelig;be had been patiently waiting alone behind the
east wall of the inn garden. As she had expected,
her step-mother had accompanied her father to London
that afternoon, and she found herself free for
the time of their watchfulness. She did not know
that this apparent carelessness was based upon knowledge
of another surveillance more strict and secret,
and therefore more effective than their own.</p>

<p>The shadow of the wall within which she was
standing lengthened more and more rapidly, until,
as the sun touched the western horizon, the whole
countryside to the east was obscured.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be moved out into the middle of the road
which ran parallel to the garden wall and looked
longingly toward the north. A few rods away, the
road curved to the right between apple-trees whose
blossoms gleamed more pink with the touch of the
setting sun.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;no one yet!" she murmured. "Oh,
Guy, if not for love, could you not haste for life!"</p>

<p>As though in answer to her exclamation, there
came to her ears a faint tapping of horses' hoofs, and
a few moments later three horsemen turned the corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
and bore down upon her.</p>

<p>One glance was enough to show her that Guy was
not one of the group, and Ph&oelig;be leaped back into
the shadow of the wall. She felt that she must not
be seen watching here alone by anyone. As she stood
beneath the fringe of trees that stood outside of the
garden wall, she looked about for means of better
concealment, and quickly noticed a narrow slit in the
high brick enclosure, just wide enough for a man to
enter. It had been barred with iron, but two of the
bars had fallen from their sockets, leaving an aperture
which looked large enough to admit a slender
girl.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be felt instinctively that the approaching
riders were unfriendly in their purpose and, without
pausing to weigh reasons, she quickly scrambled
through this accidental passage, not without tearing
her dress.</p>

<p>She found herself within the garden and not far
from the very seat where she had hidden from Will
Shakespeare. How different her situation now, she
thought. Not diffidence, but fear, was now her
motive&mdash;fear for the man she loved and whom she
alone could save.</p>

<p>While she listened there, half choked by the beating
of her own heart, she heard the three cavaliers
beyond the wall. Their horses were walking now,
and the three conversed together in easily audible
tones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>"My life on it, Will," said one, "'twas here the
wench took cover!"</p>

<p>"Thine eyes are dusty, Jack," replied a deep voice.
"'Twas farther on, was it not, Harry?"</p>

<p>The horses stopped.</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;you are i' the right, Will," was the answer.
"By the same token, how could the lass be here and
we not see her? There's naught to hide a cat withal."</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;nay!" said Will. "Count upon it, Jack,
the maid fled beyond the turn yonder. Come on,
lads!"</p>

<p>"I'll not stir hence!" said Jack, obstinately. "Who
finds the girl, catches the traitor, too. Go you two
farther, an ye will. Jack Bartley seeks here."</p>

<p>"Let it be e'en so, Will," said Harry, the third
speaker. "Dismount we here, you and me. Jack
shall tie the nags to yon tree and seek where he will.
Do you and I creep onward afoot. So shall the maid,
hearing no footfall, be caught unaware."</p>

<p>"Have it so!" said Will.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be heard the three dismount and, trembling
with apprehension, listened anxiously for knowledge
of what she dared not seek to see.</p>

<p>She heard the slow walk of the three horses, shortly
interrupted, and she knew that they were being
tethered. Then there was a murmur of voices and
silence.</p>

<p>This was the most agonizing moment of that eventful
night for Ph&oelig;be. Strain her ears as she might,
naught could she hear but the shake of a bridle, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
stamp of an occasional hoof, and the cropping of
grass. The next few seconds seemed an hour of
miserable uncertainty and suspense. She knew now
that she was watched, that perhaps her plans were
fully known, and all hope for her lover seemed past.
She had called him hither and he would walk alone
and unaided into the arms of these three mercenaries.</p>

<p>She clasped her hands and looked desperately
about her as though for inspiration. To the right
an open sward led the eye to the out-buildings surrounding
the inn. To the left a dense thicket of
trees and bushes shut in the view.</p>

<p>Suddenly she started violently. Her ear had
caught the snapping of a twig close at hand, beyond
the concealing wall. At the next moment she saw
a stealthy hand slip past the opening by which she
had entered, and the top of a man's hat appeared.</p>

<p>Like a rabbit that runs to cover, she turned noiselessly
and dashed into the friendly thicket. Here
she stopped with her hand on her heart and glanced
wildly about her. Well she knew that her concealment
here could be but momentary. Where next
could she find shelter?</p>

<p>A heap of refuse, stones and dirt, leaves and sticks,
was heaped against that portion of the wall, and at
sight of this a desperate plan crossed her mind.</p>

<p>"'Tis that or nothing!" she whispered, and, still
under cover of the shrubbery, she hurried toward the
rubbish heap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime, Jack, whose quick eye had descried
that ancient opening in the wall, perceived by
neither of his companions, was standing just within
the wall gazing about for some clue to his prey's
location.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be leaped upon the refuse heap and scrambled
to the top. To her dismay, there was a great crashing
of dead wood as she sank nearly to her knees in
the accumulated rubbish.</p>

<p>Jack uttered a loud exclamation of triumph and
leaped toward the thicket. Poor Ph&oelig;be heard his
cry, and for an instant all seemed hopeless. But
hers was a brave young soul, and, far from fainting
in her despair, a new vigor possessed her.</p>

<p>Grasping the limb of a tree beside her, she drew
herself up until, with one foot she found a firm rest
on the top of the wall. Then, forgetting her tender
hands and limbs, straining, gripping, and scrambling,
she knew not how, she flung herself over the wall
and fell in a bruised and ragged heap on the grass
beyond.</p>

<p>When her pursuer reached the thicket, he was confounded
to find no one in sight.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be lay for one moment faint and relaxed upon
the ground. The landscape turned to swimming silhouettes
before her eyes, and all sounds were momentarily
stilled. Then life came surging back in
a welcome tide and she rose unsteadily to her feet.
She walked as quickly as she could to where the three
horses stood loosely tied by their bridles to a tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
At any moment the man she feared might appear
again at the opening in the wall.</p>

<p>She untied all three horses and, choosing a powerful
gray for her own, she slipped his bridle over her
arm so as to leave both hands free. Then, bringing
together the bridles of the other two, she tied them
together in a double knot, then doubled that, and
struck the two animals sharply with the bridle of
the gray. Naturally they started off in different directions,
and, pulling at their bridles, dragged them
into harder knots than her weak fingers could have
tied.</p>

<p>She laughed in the triumph of her ingenuity and
scrambled with foot and knee and hand into place
astride of the remaining steed. Thus in the seclusion
of the pasture had she often ridden her mare
Nancy home to the barn.</p>

<p>There was a shout of anger and amazement from
the road, and she saw the two men who had elected
to walk farther on running toward her.</p>

<p>Turning her steed, she slapped his neck with the
bridle and chopped at his flanks with the stirrups
as best she could. The horse broke into an easy
canter, and for the moment she was free.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ph&oelig;be found herself virtually
without means for urging her steed to his best pace.
Accustomed as he was to the efficient severity of a
man's spurred heel, he paid little attention to her
gentle, though urgent, voice, and even the stirrups
were hardly available substitutes for spurs, since her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
feet could not reach them and she could only kick
them flapping back against the horse's sides.</p>

<p>Her one chance was that she might meet Sir Guy
in time, and she could only pray that the knots in
the bridles of the remaining horses would long defy
every effort to release them. As she turned the
curve among the apple-trees, she looked back and
saw that the horses had been caught and that all
three men were frantically tugging and picking with
fingers and teeth at those obstinate knots.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be drew up for a moment a few yards beyond
the curve and broke off a long, slender switch from
an overhanging bough. Then, urging the horse forward
again, she picked off the small branches until
at length she had produced a smooth, pliant switch,
far more effective than bridle or stirrup. By the
help of this new whip, she made a little better speed,
but well she knew that her capture was only a matter
of time unless she could find her lover.</p>

<p>Great was her joy, therefore, when she turned the
next curve in the road; for, straight ahead, not twenty
rods away, she saw Sir Guy approaching at a
canter, leading a second horse.</p>

<p>By this time the twilight was deepening, and the
young cavalier gazed in astonishment upon the ragged
girl riding toward him astride, making silent gestures
of welcome and warning. Not until he was
within twenty yards of her did Sir Guy recognize his
sweetheart.</p>

<p>"Mary!" he cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Together they reined in their horses, and instantly
Ph&oelig;be slipped to the ground.</p>

<p>"Quick, Guy&mdash;quick!" she exclaimed. "Help me
to mount yon saddle. Come&mdash;come!"</p>

<p>Leaping at once from his horse, Sir Guy lifted
Ph&oelig;be to the back of the beast he had been leading,
which was provided with a side-saddle, the stirrup
of which carried a spur. Stopping only to kiss her
hand, he mounted his own steed, turned about, and
followed Ph&oelig;be, who had already set off at her best
speed. Even as they started, they heard a shout
behind them, and Ph&oelig;be knew that the pursuit had
begun in earnest.</p>

<p>"What is it&mdash;who are they whom you flee?" asked
the young knight, as he came to Ph&oelig;be's side.</p>

<p>"Men seeking thee, Guy&mdash;for reward! There is
a price on thy head, dear. For high treason! Oh,
may God aid us this night!"</p>

<p>"High treason!" he exclaimed. Then, after a
pause, he continued, in a stern voice:</p>

<p>"How many be they?"</p>

<p>"Two."</p>

<p>Sir Guy laughed in evident relief.</p>

<p>"But two! By my troth, why should we fear them,
sweetheart?" he said. "An I be not a match for four
of these scurvy rascals, call me not knight!"</p>

<p>"Alas&mdash;alas!" cried Ph&oelig;be, in alarm, as she saw
Sir Guy slacken his pace. "Stay not to fight, Guy.
Urge on&mdash;urge on! The whole countryside is
awake. How, then, canst thou better thee by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
fighting two? Nay, on&mdash;on!" and she spurred again,
beckoning him after with an imperious hand.</p>

<p>He yielded to her reasoning, and soon reached her
side again.</p>

<p>"We must to London Bridge, Guy," Ph&oelig;be said.
"Know you a way back thither?"</p>

<p>"Wherefore to London, sweet?" asked Guy.
"Were we not safer far afield? Why seek the shadow
of the Tower?"</p>

<p>"One way is left thee," said she, with intense earnestness.
"A way that is known to me alone. Thereby
only canst thou escape. Oh, trust me&mdash;trust me,
dear heart! Only I can guide thee to safety and
to freedom!"</p>

<p>"On, my Mary!" he cried, gayly. "Lead on! Thou
art my star!"</p>

<p>For the moment both forgot the danger behind
them. The intoxication of an ideal and self-forgetting
trust&mdash;a merger of all else in tenderness&mdash;flooded
their souls and passed back and forth between
them in their mutual glances.</p>

<p>Then came that pursuing shout again, much nearer
than before, and with a shock the two lovers remembered
their true plight.</p>

<p>Sir Guy reined in his steed.</p>

<p>"Halt&mdash;halt, Mary!" he commanded. "We must
conceal us here in this dell till that these fellows
pass us. Then back to London by the way we came.
There is no other road."</p>

<p>Obedient now in her turn, Ph&oelig;be drew rein and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
followed her lover up the bed of a small stream
which crossed the road at this point. Behind a curtain
of trees they waited, and ere long saw their two
pursuers dart past them and disappear in a cloud of
dust down the road.</p>

<p>"They will stop at the next dwelling to ask news
of us, and thus learn of our evasion," said Guy. "The
chase has but begun. Come, sweet, let us hasten
southward again."</p>

<p>Darkness had now begun to fall in earnest, and
as the two fugitives passed the Peacock Inn, no one
saw them.</p>

<p>They were soon near enough to the city gate to
find many houses on either hand, and Sir Guy deemed
it wiser to move at a reasonable pace, for fear of attracting
suspicion in a neighborhood already aroused
by rumors of the man-hunt which had begun. They
could count upon the obscurity to conceal their identity.</p>

<p>They had not proceeded far beyond the inn when
they met a party of travellers on horseback, one of
whom uttered a pleasant "Good-even!"</p>

<p>"Good-even!" said Ph&oelig;be, thinking only of due
courtesy.</p>

<p>"What the good jere!" cried a voice from the rear
of the group. "What dost thou here, Poll?"</p>

<p>"My father!" exclaimed Ph&oelig;be, in terror.</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered Sir Guy, putting his hand upon
her bridle. "Ride forward at an easy gait until I
give example of haste."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>They trotted quietly past the greater number of
the group until a dark figure approached and a voice
in the gloom said, severely:</p>

<p>"What dost thou here? Who rides with thee,
lass?"</p>

<p>Sir Guy now leaned forward and spurred his horse,
leaping away into the darkness without a word. In
equal silence Ph&oelig;be followed his example and galloped
headlong close behind her lover.</p>

<p>"Help, ho!" yelled old Sir Isaac. "'Tis the traitor
Fenton, with my daughter! After them&mdash;stop them&mdash;a
Burton&mdash;a Burton!" and, mad with excitement,
the angry father set off in hot pursuit. With one
accord the others wheeled about and joined in the
chase, uttering cries and imprecations that rang
through the country for a mile around.</p>

<p>"Now have we need of speed!" said Sir Guy, as
they galloped together toward London, whose walls
were now visible in the distance. "Soon will the
whole country join the hue-and-cry. The watch will
meet us at the gate."</p>

<p>"'Twere better, were it not," Ph&oelig;be suggested,
"that we turn to the left and make a circuit into the
Aldersgate?"</p>

<p>"Good wit, my lady!" cried Guy, whose excitement
had taken on the form of an exalted gayety. "Who
rides with thee rides safe, my love&mdash;e'en as Theseus
of old did ride, scathless 'neath the spell of protecting
Pallas!"</p>

<p>"Stuff!" said Ph&oelig;be, spurring again, with a smile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>Guy led the way at once across country to the eastward,
the soft English turf so deadening their hoof-beats
that those behind them had no clue to their
change of route.</p>

<p>When the pursuing party reached the Bishopsgate,
they met the watch and learned that no one had
passed since the hue-and-cry was heard.</p>

<p>"Here divide we, then," cried stout Sir Isaac
Burton. "Let eight follow them around the wall,
while I with other six ride on, that, if haply they
have entered London by the Aldersgate, we may
meet them within the city."</p>

<p>The suggestion was adopted, and, all unconscious
of their peril, the lovers were rapidly hemmed in
between two bands of pursuers. Sir Guy and Ph&oelig;be
reached the Aldersgate unmolested and were allowed
to pass in without protest, as the hue-and-cry had
not yet reached so far. They ambled quietly past
the watch, arousing no suspicion, but no sooner had
they turned the first corner than once more they
urged their tired horses to greater exertion.</p>

<p>"Choose we the side streets," said Guy. "Who
knows what watch hath been set on Gracechurch
Street. 'Tis for London Bridge we are bound, is't
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ph&oelig;be. "I pray no prying watch detain
us ere we pass that way!"</p>

<p>Picking their way through the dark and narrow
streets at a pace necessarily much reduced, they slowly
approached their goal, until at length, on emerg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>ing
into New Fish Street, they discerned the towering
walls of London Bridge.</p>

<p>Here they reined in suddenly with one accord, for,
plainly visible in the moonlight, a group of horsemen
was gathered and there was borne to their ears
the sturdy voice of Sir Isaac.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he cried. "There be riders in New Fish
Street. See where they lurk in the shadow! What
ho, there! Give a name! Stand forth there!"</p>

<p>Sir Guy drew his sword.</p>

<p>"'Tis time for steel to answer!" he laughed.</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;nay! Wait&mdash;wait!" said Ph&oelig;be, earnestly.
"There must be other issue than in blood!"</p>

<p>Two or three horsemen now detached themselves
from the group near the bridge and cantered up New
Fish Street. Sir Isaac was among them.</p>

<p>"Are ye there, traitor?" he cried. "Where is my
daughter?"</p>

<p>Sir Guy was about to reply when Ph&oelig;be put her
hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered. "Hearken!"</p>

<p>Faint at first, but growing momentarily louder,
there came the clear trilling of a mysterious bell.
It floated out from the dark by-ways whence they
had themselves just emerged, and something eerie
and uncanny in its clamor brought a thrill of
terror to the young knight's nerves for the first
time.</p>

<p>"Now, what in God's name&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>But he broke off in horror, for there flashed past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
him, as silent as the wind and swifter, a dark, bent
figure, with flying cloak, under which, as the moonlight
struck him, there whirled a web of glittering
tissue whereon he seemed to ride. That uncanny
tinkling floated back from this strange vision, confirming
to the ear what otherwise might have appeared
a mere trick of the vision.</p>

<p>As for Sir Isaac and his band, the distant bell had
early brought them to a wondering stand; and now,
as this rushing phantom&mdash;trilling&mdash;trilling&mdash;trilling&mdash;swept
down on a living moonbeam, with one accord
they put spurs to their steeds, and with cries
of horror fled in all directions.</p>

<p>"Forward!" cried Ph&oelig;be, exultantly. "Why, what
now!" she exclaimed, as she saw her lover still sitting
petrified with fear. "How now, my knight! Why
sit you here amazed? Is not the way clear? Come&mdash;follow&mdash;follow!"
and she started forward on a
trot.</p>

<p>But her lover did not move, and she was obliged
to turn back. Laying her hand on his arm:</p>

<p>"Why, what ails thee, dear heart?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The spectre&mdash;the ghostly steed!" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh!" laughed Ph&oelig;be. "Why, this was but
some venturous bicyclist on his wheel!"</p>

<p>"A bicyclist!" exclaimed Sir Guy. "Can you thus
give a name to this black phantom, Mary?"</p>

<p>"'Tis naught, dear Guy, believe me!" she said.
Then, in pleading tones, she continued: "Didst not
agree to trust thy lady, dear?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>The young knight passed his hand over his eyes
and straightened himself resolutely in his saddle.</p>

<p>"E'en to the death, love. Lead on! I shall not
falter!"</p>

<p>They trotted forward through a now silent street
to the bridge, and soon found themselves enveloped
in the darkness and assailed by the countless odors
of London Bridge. From time to time they crossed
a path of moonlight, and here Ph&oelig;be would smile
into the eyes of her still much-puzzled lover and murmur
words of encouragement.</p>

<p>Before they reached Southwark, there rang out
behind them the sound of hoofs upon the stones of
the bridge.</p>

<p>"Can these be your father's minions, think you?"
said Sir Guy.</p>

<p>"Nay!" Ph&oelig;be exclaimed. "Rest assured, they
were scattered too far to dog our steps again to-night."</p>

<p>They emerged some moments later on the Southwark
side and saw the pillory towering ahead of them.</p>

<p>"How far shall we fare to-night, love?" asked the
knight.</p>

<p>"To Newington on horseback," Ph&oelig;be replied,
"and then&mdash;well, then shalt thou see more faring."</p>

<p>There was a loud cry from the bridge, startling
the pair from their fancied security.</p>

<p>"There they ride! The watch, ho! Stop the
traitor! Stop him! For the Queen! For the
Queen!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>"God help us!" cried Ph&oelig;be. "'Tis the two yeomen

<p>With one accord the pair clapped spurs to their
horses' sides and resumed once more the flight which
they had thought concluded.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">REBECCA'S TRUMP CARD</h3>


<p>When Rebecca set out for the Panchronicon from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
London Bridge, she knew that she had a long walk
in prospect, and settled down to the work with
dogged resolution. Her trip was quite uneventful
until she neared the village of Newington, and then
she realized for the first time that she did not know
exactly where to find the deserted grove. One grove
looked much like another, and how was she to choose
between garden walls "as like as two peas," as she
expressed it?</p>

<p>"Look here, Rebecca Wise," she said, aloud, as
she paused in the middle of the road, "you'll be lost
next you know!"</p>

<p>She looked about dubiously and shook her head.</p>

<p>"The thing fer you to do is to set right down an'
wait fer that pesky good-fer-nothin' Copernicus
Droop!" she remarked, and suiting action to speech
she picked her way to a convenient mile-stone and
seated herself.</p>

<p>Having nothing better to do, she began to review
mentally the events of the last two days, and as she
recalled one after the other the unprecedented adventures
which had overtaken her, she wondered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
a dreamy way what would next befall. She built
hazy hypotheses, sitting there alone in the moonlight,
nodding contentedly. Suddenly she straightened up,
realizing that she had been aroused from a doze by
a cry near at hand.</p>

<p>Turning toward London, she saw a wriggling mass
about fifty feet away which, by a process of slow
disentanglement, gradually developed into a man's
form rising from the ground and raising a fallen
bicycle.</p>

<p>"Darn the luck!" said this dark figure. "Busted
my tire, sure as shootin'!"</p>

<p>"Copernicus Droop!" cried Rebecca, in a loud
voice.</p>

<p>Droop jumped high in the air, so great was his
nervousness. Then, realizing that it was Rebecca
who had addressed him, he limped toward her, rolling
his bicycle beside him.</p>

<p>"How in creation did you get here?" he asked.
"Ain't any steam-cars 'round here, is there?"</p>

<p>"Guess not!" Rebecca replied. "I come by short
cut up river. I guessed you'd make fer the Panchronicle,
and I jest made up my mind to come, too.
Thinks I, 'that Copernicus Droop ud be jest mean
enough to fly away all by himself an' leave me an'
Ph&oelig;be to shift fer ourselves.' So I'm here to go,
too&mdash;an' what's more, we've got to take Ph&oelig;be!"</p>

<p>"How'll ye find yer sister, Cousin Rebecca?" said
Droop. "We must git out to-night. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Queen gets on her ear like that, it's now or never.
Can you find Cousin Ph&oelig;be to-night?"</p>

<p>"Where is the old machine, anyhow?" Rebecca
asked, not heeding Droop's question.</p>

<p>"Right over yonder," said he, pointing to a dark
group of trees a few rods distant.</p>

<p>"Well, come on, then. Let's go to it right away,"
said Rebecca. "I'd like to rest a bit. I'm tired!"</p>

<p>"Tired!" Droop exclaimed. "What about me,
then?"</p>

<p>Without further parley, the two set off toward
the grove which Droop had indicated. Having dwelt
here for several weeks, he knew his bearings well,
but it was not until they came much nearer to the
deserted mansion that Rebecca recognized several
landmarks which convinced her that he had made
no mistake.</p>

<p>Under the trees, the shadows were so black that
they were unable to find the breach in the wall.</p>

<p>"Got any matches, Cousin Rebecca?" Droop asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. Wait a minute an' I'll strike a light. I
know that blessed hole is somewhere right near here."</p>

<p>She found again her card of matches, and breaking
off one of them, soon had a tiny taper which lit up
their surroundings wonderfully.</p>

<p>"There 'tis! I've found it," cried Droop, and,
taking Rebecca by the arm, he led her toward the
broken place in the wall. The match went out just
as they reached it.</p>

<p>Droop was about to suggest that he go in first to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
see if all was well, when he was startled by Rebecca's
hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Hark!" she cried.</p>

<p>He listened and distant cries coming nearer
through the night were borne to his ears.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Rebecca exclaimed again.</p>

<p>Rigid with excitement and dread, they stood there
listening. At length Droop pulled himself free of
Rebecca's hold.</p>

<p>"That's some o' them palace folks chasin' after
me!" he cried, in a panic.</p>

<p>"Fiddle-dee-dee!" Rebecca exclaimed, with energy.
"How should they know where you are?"</p>

<p>By this time the sounds were more distinct, and
they could easily make out cries of: "Traitor! Stop
him! For the Queen! Stop him!"</p>

<p>The two listeners had just mentally concluded that
this alarm did not in any wise concern them when
Rebecca was startled beyond measure to hear her
sister Ph&oelig;be's voice, loud above all other sounds.</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;nay, Guy!" she was screaming. "Stop not
to fight! Fly&mdash;follow! Shelter is here at hand!"</p>

<p>Forgetting everything but possible danger for
Ph&oelig;be, Rebecca dashed out from under the trees.</p>

<p>There in the moonlight she saw Ph&oelig;be on horseback,
her head uncovered, her hair floating free and
her clothing in tatters. A few paces behind her was
Sir Guy, also mounted, fiercely attacking two pursuing
horsemen with his sword. Farther back, rendered
indistinct by distance, was a larger group of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
mingled horse and foot travellers. There was a lantern
among them, and Rebecca inferred that the
watch was with them.</p>

<p>A moment later, one of the two men engaged with
Sir Guy fell from his horse. Instantly the young
knight turned upon the second pursuer, who fled at
once toward the larger group now rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>Rebecca ran forward and waved her card of
matches frantically, apparently thinking in her excitement
that she held a flag.</p>

<p>"Here, Ph&oelig;be&mdash;here, child!" she screamed. "This
way, quick! Here we are awaitin' fer ye. Come,
quick&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>With a loud cry of joy, Ph&oelig;be slipped from her
horse and ran toward her sister.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rebecca, Rebecca!" she cried, throwing herself
into her sister's arms. "Oh, you dear, lovely,
sweet old darling!"</p>

<p>Rebecca kissed her younger sister with tears in
her eyes, almost as affected as the girl herself, who
was now laughing and crying hysterically on her
breast.</p>

<p>While they stood thus tightly locked in each
other's arms, Guy came to their side with sword in
hand.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he said, sharply. "You must away to
shelter. Here comes the watch apace. I will protect
the rear."</p>

<p>The two women started apart and Ph&oelig;be set for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>ward
obediently, but Rebecca only gave the fast-approaching
crowd a look of proud contempt.</p>

<p>"Fiddle-ends!" she exclaimed. "You go on ahead,
Guy. I'll fix them queer folks!"</p>

<p>Whether Rebecca's voice convinced him of her
power to make good her words or that he felt his
first duty was at Ph&oelig;be's side, the fact is that the
young knight strode forward with his sweetheart
toward the breach in the wall, leaving Rebecca behind
to bear the first attack.</p>

<p>Droop had already passed within the enclosure
and was groping his way toward the black mass of
the Panchronicon.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be, led by an accurate memory of her surroundings,
had but little difficulty in finding the
opening, and, by her voice, Sir Guy and Rebecca
were guided to it.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be passed through first and Sir Guy followed
just as the advance guard of the pursuing mob rushed
under the trees, swinging their two lanterns and
shouting aloud:</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;this way! We have 'em fast!"</p>

<p>Rebecca coolly stooped and drew the edge of her
entire card of matches across a stone at her feet.
Then, standing erect, she thrust the sulphurous blue
blaze into the faces of two rough-looking fellows just
advancing to seize her.</p>

<p>Sir Guy, who stood within the wall, found cause
for deep amazement in the yell of startled fear with
which Rebecca's act was met; and deeper yet grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
his astonishment when that cry was re-echoed by the
whole terror-stricken mob, who turned as one man
to flee from this flaming, sulphurous sorceress.</p>

<p>Rebecca quietly waited until the sulphur had
burned off and the wood blazed bright and clear.
Then she pushed through the broken wall and showed
the way to their destination by the light of the small
torch.</p>

<p>Sir Guy's feelings may be imagined when he suddenly
found that they were all four standing before
a strangely formed structure in the side of which
Copernicus had just opened a door.</p>

<p>"Why, Mary!" he exclaimed, pausing in his walk.
"What have we here?"</p>

<p>She took his hand with a smile and drew him gently
forward.</p>

<p>"Trust thy Mary yet further, Guy," she said.
"Thy watchword must be, 'Trust and question not.'"</p>

<p>He smiled in reply and, sheathing his sword,
stepped boldly forward into the interior of the Panchronicon.
Ph&oelig;be knew the power of superstition
in that age, and she glowed with pride and tenderness,
conscious that in this act of faith in her the
knight evinced more courage than ever he might
need to bear him well in battle.</p>

<p>When the electric lights shed a sudden bright
glare down the spiral staircase, Sir Guy cowered and
stopped short again, turning pale with a fear irrepressible.
But Ph&oelig;be put one arm about his neck
and drew his head down to hers, whispering in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
ear. What she said none heard save him, but the
spell of her words was potent, for the young knight
stood erect once more and firmly ascended to the
room above.</p>

<p>Droop stood nervously waiting at the engine-room
door.</p>

<p>"Are ye all in?" he said, sharply. "Where's
Cousin Rebecca?"</p>

<p>"Here I be!" came a voice from below. "I'm jest
lockin' the door tight."</p>

<p>"Well, hurry up&mdash;hurry! Come up here an' lay
down. I'm goin' to start."</p>

<p>In a few moments all was in readiness. Droop
pulled the lever, and with a roar and a mighty bound
the Panchronicon, revived by its long period of waiting,
sped upward into the night.</p>

<p>As the four fugitives sat upright again, and Droop,
rubbing his hands with satisfaction, was about to
speak, the door of one of the bedchambers was
opened, and a stranger dressed in nineteenth-century
attire stepped forward, shading his blinking eyes with
his hand.</p>

<p>The two women screamed, but Droop only dropped
amazed into a chair.</p>

<p>"Francis Bacon!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Then, leaping forward eagerly, he cried aloud:</p>

<p>"Gimme them clothes!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Of the return trip of the five, little need be said
save to record one untoward incident which has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
the occasion of a most unfortunate historic controversy.</p>

<p>The date-recording instrument must have been deranged
in some way, for when, after a great number
of eastward turns around the pole, it marked the
year 1898, they had really only reached 1857. Supposing
themselves to have actually reached the year
erroneously indicated by the recorder, they set off
southward and made a first landing in Hartford,
Connecticut.</p>

<p>Here they discovered their mistake, and returned
to the pole to complete their journey in time. All
but Francis Bacon. He declared that so much whirling
made him giddy, and remained in Connecticut.
Alas! Had Ph&oelig;be known the result of this desertion,
she would never have consented to it.</p>

<p>Bacon, who had read much of Shakespeare while
in the Panchronicon, found on returning thus accidentally
to modern America, that this playwright
was esteemed the first and greatest of poets and
dramatists by the modern world. Then and there
he planned a conspiracy to rob the greatest character
in literary history of his just fame; and, under
the pseudonym of "Delia Bacon," advanced those
theories of his own concealed authorship which have
ever since deluded the uncritical and disgusted all
lovers of common-sense and of justice.</p>

<p>Copernicus Droop, on returning his three remaining
passengers to their proper dates and addresses,
discovered that his sole remaining phonograph, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
certain valuable records of Elizabethan origin, had
disappeared. As he owed a grudge to Francis Bacon,
that worthy fell at once under suspicion, and accordingly
Droop promptly returned to 1857, sought out
the deserter, and charged him with having stolen
these instruments.</p>

<p>It was not until the accused man had indignantly
denied all knowledge of Droop's property that the
crestfallen Yankee recollected that he had left the
apparatus in question in the deserted mansion of
Newington, where he had stored it for greater safety
after Bacon's first unexpected visit.</p>

<p>Without hesitation, he determined to return to
1598 and reclaim his own. Bacon, who had learned
from modern historical works of the brilliant future
in store for himself in England, begged Droop to
take him back; and as an atonement for his unjust
accusation, Droop consented.</p>

<p>It is not generally known that, contrary to common
report, Francis Bacon was <i>not</i> arrested for debt
in 1598; but that, during the time he was supposed
to have been in prison, he was actually engaged in
building up in his own behalf the greatest hoax in
history.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Let those who may be inclined to discredit this
scrupulously authentic chronicle proceed forthwith
to Peltonville, New Hampshire, and there ask for
Mr. and Mrs. Guy Fenton. From them will be
gained complete corroboration of this history, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
only in the account which they will give of their own
past adventures, but in the unmistakable Elizabethan
flavor distinguishable to this day in their speech and
manner. Indeed, the single fact that both ale and
beer are to be found behind their wood-pile should
be convincing evidence on this point.</p>

<p>As for Rebecca, fully convinced at last of the marvellous
qualities of the Panchronicon, she never tires
of taking her little nephew, Isaac Burton Wise Fenton,
on her knee and telling him of her amazing adventures
in the palace of "Miss Tudor."</p>
